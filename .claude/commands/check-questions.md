Perform the following steps on question files $ARGUMENTS in the current folder and fix any issues:

- Check that each question text ends with a question (preceded by a blank line), and that the texts of the answers are plausible answers to the stated question.
- Check that questions do not ask to evaluate a statement. Instead, the questions should quiz the user about the scenario presented in the question text.
- Check that each question has at least 4 answers (unless the question has Yes/No answers).
- Check that there are no spelling and grammar mistakes in the question text and answers.
- Check that there are no coding mistakes in the question text.
- Make sure the "layout" frontmatter property is correct, by checking if there is only one correct answer or if there are more than one correct answers.  
- Check the explanations for each answer. 
- Make sure the url in the "link" property refers to an existing web page that explains the topic quizzed by each question.
- Make sure the "title" and "learn" properties have the first letter of each word capitalized.
- Check that all answers marked correct are indeed correct. 
- Check that the questions refer to MDFT Pro and describe an educational scenario.
- Check that the question scenario mentions that the student doing the quiz is working for MDFT Pro or has been hired by Mark at MDFT Pro to perform a specific task.
