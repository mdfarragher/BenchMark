Read the $ARGUMENTS file and split it into separate files, like this:

- Read the file and figure out where each question ends and the next question starts.
- Put the full text of each individual question and its corresponding answers in a separate file
- Use the question number as the filename. So question number 1 goes into file '1.md', question number 2 goes into '2.md' and so on. 

Make sure that you end up with 75 question files in the current folder.
