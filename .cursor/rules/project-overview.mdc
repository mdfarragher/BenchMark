# Purpose

BenchMark is a web-based quiz app that helps technology professionals get ready for their Microsoft certification exams. The app is specifically designed to work well on mobile, but can also be used on desktops and laptops. There is no login or registration, because the content is free for everyone to use. BenchMark prioritizes performance and lightweight web pages, and therefore does not use any javascript application framework. 

When a student uses BenchMark and gets a question wrong, the app immediately shows the correct answer and provides an explanation for each wrong answer. The explanation clearly describes why each incorrect listed answer is wrong. Also, BenchMark shows a link to an online page (preferrably on Microsoft Learn) that provides more information about the subject being quizzed. Students can follow the link to learn more about the subject and improve their skills.

# Platform

Benchmark uses the Hugo static site generator to generate web pages from markdown content and template files. The markdown files represent quiz descriptions, quiz questions and other web page content used in the app. The Hugo template files are used to process the markdown content and render it into htlm files.

# Folder structure

This project uses a default Hugo project layout with the following content folder structure:

/content/_index.md                          a welcome page describing the BenchMark app
/content/c/certification/                   all content for a specific Miccrosoft certification
/content/c/certification/q/quiz/            all content for one certification practice quiz
/content/c/certification/q/quiz/_index.md   description of the practice quiz
/content/c/certification/q/quiz/1.md        question 1 of the practice quiz
/content/c/certification/q/quiz/results.md  results page content of the practice quiz

For an example of what the quiz question markdown should look like, please refer to [1.md](mdc:content/c/md102-endpoint-administrator/q/exam-preparation-quiz/1.md)

# Objective

The goal is for BenchMark to contain as many Microsoft certification exam practice quizzes as posssible. I will copy and paste quiz questions from various sources into the project. Your task is to reformat the text, convert it to markdown, add explanations for wrong answers, and provide links to online Microsoft Learn pages that explain the topic of each question.
