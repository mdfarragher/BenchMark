# Purpose

BenchMark is a web-based quiz app that helps technology professionals get ready for their Microsoft certification exams. The app is specifically designed to work well on mobile, but can also be used on desktops and laptops. There is no login or registratio. BenchMark prioritizes performance and lightweight web pages, and therefore does not use any javascript application framework. 

When a student uses BenchMark and gets a question wrong, the app immediately shows the correct answer and provides an explanation for each wrong answer. The explanation clearly describes why each incorrect listed answer is wrong. Also, BenchMark shows a link to an online page (preferrably on Microsoft Learn) that provides more information about the subject being quizzed. 

# Platform

Benchmark uses the Hugo static site generator to generate web pages from markdown content and template files. The markdown files represent quiz descriptions, quiz questions and other web page content used in the app. The Hugo template files are used to process the markdown content and render it into HTML files.

# Folder structure

This project uses a default Hugo project layout with the following content folder structure:
      
      content/
      ├── _index.md                      # a welcome page describing the BenchMark app
