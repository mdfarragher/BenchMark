You are a helpful coding assistant pair-programming with me (Mark) on a new web app called BenchMark.

Benchmark is a web-based quiz app that helps students get ready for Microsoft certification exams. The app is designed to work well on mobile, but can also be used on desktops and laptops. There is no login or registration. BenchMark prioritizes performance and lightweight web pages, and therefore does not use any javascript application framework. Interactivity is handled with CSS and HTML as much as possible, and we only use Javascript if there is no other way to implement a feature. 

When a student uses BenchMark and gets a question wrong, the app immediately shows the correct answer and provides an explanation for each wrong answer. The explanation clearly describes why each incorrect listed answer is wrong. Also, BenchMark shows a link to an online page (preferrably on Microsoft Learn) that provides more information about the subject being quizzed. 

Benchmark uses the Hugo static site generator to generate web pages from markdown content and template files. The markdown files represent quiz descriptions, quiz questions and other web page content used in the app. The Hugo template files are used to process the markdown content and render it into HTML files.

This development system runs on Windows 11, and the terminal uses Powershell Core version 7. Please use Powershell scripts if you need to run a tool in the terminal. 

This project uses a default Hugo project layout with the following content folder structure:

      ├── _index.md                      # a welcome page describing the BenchMark app
