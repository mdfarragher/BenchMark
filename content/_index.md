Are you preparing for a Microsoft certification? Your best strategy to pass the exam is to collect many practice questions, and rehearse them over and over until you know the subject matter by heart.

That's why I created my own exam prep platform called **BenchMark**. There, you will find a large collection of practice exams that will prepare you for the real Microsoft certification exams. Each practice exam has 75 questions and you need to get at least 70% correct to pass, just like on the real certification exams. 

I built BenchMark as a place to share the practice exams I create for my classroom students. My goal is to get you ready for your certification exam and ensure you cannot fail.

Right now, all exams on this site are free to access, but I will eventually put them behind a paywall. As an [All-Access Member](https://www.mdft.academy/all-access-membership), you'll retain full access to every quiz.
