Are you preparing for a Microsoft certification? Your best strategy to ace the exam is to collect realistic practice exams and study each question until you know the subject matter by heart. Practice exams provide a realistic simulation of the real exam experience, and can help you identify technical subjects you need to practice more.

This is why we created this exam prep platform called **BenchMark**. Here you will find a large collection of realistic practice exams that prepare you for Microsoft certifications. The passing grades are the same as for the real exams, and you'll get extensive help and feedback if you get a question wrong.

Our goal with Benchmark is to get you ready for your next certification and ensure you cannot fail.
