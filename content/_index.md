Are you preparing for a Microsoft certification? Your best strategy to pass the exam is to collect many practice questions, and rehearse them over and over until you know the subject matter by heart.

That's why I created my own exam prep platform called **BenchMark**. Here, you will find a large selection of practice exams that complement the Microsoft video lectures on the [MDFT Pro Academy](https://www.mdft.academy) website. The exams will prepare you for select Microsoft certifications and provide extensive help and feedback if you get a question wrong. 

My goal with Benchmark is to get you ready for your next certification and make sure you cannot fail.
