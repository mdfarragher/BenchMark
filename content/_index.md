Hi, I'm Mark Farragher, the creator of BenchMark and the author of all the quizzes you'll find here.

I built BenchMark as a collection of interactive practice quizzes to help you get ready for your next Microsoft certification exam. Each quiz is designed to reflect the style and content of real Microsoft certification questions, so that you can assess your knowledge and focus your study efforts where it matters most.

Whether you're working toward a new Microsoft certification or just want to test your skills, I hope you'll find these quizzes fun and effective. Dive in, challenge yourself, and track your progress as you prepare for exam success.

Good luck trying to beat the passing score!
