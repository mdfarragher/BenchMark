Are you preparing for a Microsoft certification? Your best strategy to pass the exam is to collect many practice questions, and rehearse them over and over until you know the subject matter by heart.

That's why I created my own exam prep platform called **BenchMark**. Here you will find a large collection of practice exams that will prepare you for your Microsoft certification. Each exam has 75 questions and you need to get 70% correct to pass, just like on the real Microsoft exam.  

My goal with Benchmark Practice Exams is to get you ready for your next certification and make sure you will not fail.
