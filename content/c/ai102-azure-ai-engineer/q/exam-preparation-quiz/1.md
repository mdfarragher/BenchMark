MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, operates an Azure OpenAI resource named Students-AI that hosts three deployments of the GPT-3.5 model. Each deployment is optimized for different educational workloads: student assessment, content generation, and interactive tutoring. 

Mark, the Chief Learning Officer at MDFT Pro, plans to deploy three educational applications that will access Students-AI using the REST API. Each application needs to use the deployment that was optimized for its specific educational purpose. The solution must ensure that only these authorized educational applications can access the Students-AI resource.

What should Mark use to provide secure access to Students-AI?
