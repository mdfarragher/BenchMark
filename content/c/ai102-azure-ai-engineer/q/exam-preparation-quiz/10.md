MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, has deployed a student support chatbot that uses Azure AI Language question answering to help students with course-related inquiries. Mark, the Student Services Director, has received feedback that the chatbot's responses to off-topic or irrelevant questions lack the professional formality expected in an educational environment. 

Students are receiving casual, informal responses when they ask spurious questions that aren't related to course content. The chatbot needs to maintain a professional tone even when handling questions outside its knowledge base to reflect MDFT Pro's educational standards.

A proposed solution is to change the chitchat source in Language Studio from the default to qna_chitchat_friendly.tsv, then retrain and republish the model.

Does this solution meet the goal of providing formal responses to spurious questions?
