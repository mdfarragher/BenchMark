MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, operates a student support chatbot powered by Language Understanding service to handle natural language queries from students and prospective learners. Claire, the Digital Experience Manager, has received numerous complaints from users that the chatbot frequently responds with generic messages like "Sorry, I don't understand that" when students ask legitimate questions about course enrollment, scheduling, prerequisites, and certification requirements. 

The current model seems unable to recognize many variations of common student inquiries, significantly impacting the user experience and requiring human intervention for basic support requests.

Which three actions should Claire perform in sequence to improve the chatbot's ability to respond to student requests?
