MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, is developing an intelligent student support chatbot to handle course inquiries and provide instant answers to frequently asked questions. Mark, the Lead Bot Developer, has created a QnA Maker resource containing comprehensive course information and implemented a chatbot using the Azure Bot Framework SDK. 

The chatbot needs to effectively integrate these components to provide accurate, ranked responses to student questions about course schedules, prerequisites, enrollment procedures, and certification requirements. The integration must ensure the chatbot selects the most relevant answers from the knowledge base based on student queries.

Which property should Mark configure to properly integrate the QnA Maker resource with the chatbot framework?
