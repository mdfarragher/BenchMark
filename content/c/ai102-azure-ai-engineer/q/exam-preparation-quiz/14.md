MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, operates an on-premises learning management system that tracks student engagement patterns and course completion metrics. Claire, the Data Analytics Manager, needs to implement anomaly detection to identify unusual patterns in student behavior, such as sudden drops in engagement or irregular learning schedules, which might indicate students at risk of dropping out. 

The organization has an Azure subscription with an Anomaly Detector resource, but due to data privacy requirements, they need to host the anomaly detection service on their on-premises Docker host server named "TrainingServer1" rather than processing student data in the cloud.

Which parameter must Claire include in the docker run command to properly deploy the Anomaly Detector container?
