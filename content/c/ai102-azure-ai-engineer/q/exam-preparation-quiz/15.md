MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, is developing a content analysis system to automatically extract key topics and concepts from course feedback, student essays, and training materials. 

Mark, the Educational Technology Developer, is implementing a text processing solution using Azure Text Analytics to identify important phrases that can help categorize content, improve search functionality, and generate topic summaries for course materials. The system needs to process large volumes of educational text and extract meaningful key phrases that represent the main concepts discussed in student submissions and course content.

Here is the method Mark is developing:

```csharp
static void GetKeyPhrases(TextAnalyticsClient textAnalyticsClient, string text)
{
    var response = textAnalyticsClient.__________(text);
    Console.WriteLine("Key phrases:");
    foreach (string keyphrase in response.Value)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"\t{keyphrase}");
    }
}
```

What method should be called in the placeholder to extract key phrases from the text?
