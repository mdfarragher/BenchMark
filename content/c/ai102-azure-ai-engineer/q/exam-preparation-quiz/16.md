### Question 16

You are developing a text processing solution.  
You develop the following method.

```csharp
static void GetKeyPhrases(TextAnalyticsClient textAna1yticsCIient, string text)
{
	var response = textAnalyticsClient.ExtractKeyPhrases(text);
	Console.WriteLine("Key phrases:");
	foreach (string keyphrase in response.Value)
	{
		Console.WriteLine($"\t{keyphrase}");
	}
}
```

You call the method by using the following code.  

```csharp
GetKeyPhrases(textAnalyticsClient, "the cat sat on the mat");  
```

For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. 
NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

The output will contain the following words: the, cat, sat, on, and mat.
