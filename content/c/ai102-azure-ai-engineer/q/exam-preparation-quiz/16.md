MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, is implementing an automated content analysis system for processing student course evaluations and feedback. Claire, the Data Science Manager, is testing the key phrase extraction functionality to ensure it properly identifies important concepts from student comments. 

The system uses Azure Text Analytics to extract meaningful phrases that help understand student sentiment and identify common themes in course feedback. She needs to understand exactly what output to expect when processing simple text samples to properly configure the downstream analysis pipeline.

The following method is being tested:

```csharp
static void GetKeyPhrases(TextAnalyticsClient textAnalyticsClient, string text)
{
    var response = textAnalyticsClient.ExtractKeyPhrases(text);
    Console.WriteLine("Key phrases:");
    foreach (string keyphrase in response.Value)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"\t{keyphrase}");
    }
}
```

When called with `GetKeyPhrases(textAnalyticsClient, "the cat sat on the mat");`, will the output contain all these words: the, cat, sat, on, and mat?
