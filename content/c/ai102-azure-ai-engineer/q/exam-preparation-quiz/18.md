MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, operates a student support chatbot using Azure AI Language question answering to help students with course-related inquiries. Claire, the Student Experience Director, has received feedback that when students ask off-topic or irrelevant questions unrelated to courses, the chatbot provides casual, informal responses that don't align with the professional educational environment they want to maintain. 

The current chitchat responses use friendly, conversational language that, while engaging, doesn't reflect the formal tone expected in academic and professional training contexts. The chatbot needs to maintain professionalism even when handling questions outside its primary knowledge base.

A proposed solution is to change the chitchat source in Language Studio from the default to qna_chitchat_professional.tsv, then retrain and republish the model.

Does this solution meet the goal of providing formal responses to spurious questions?
