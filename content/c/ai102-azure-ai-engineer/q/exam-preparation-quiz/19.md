answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "GPT-3.5"
      correct: false
      explain: "GPT-3.5 is designed for text generation and conversation, not for creating numeric vector representations of documents for similarity comparison."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "GPT-4"
      correct: false
      explain: "GPT-4 is primarily a language generation model and doesn't provide the embedding vectors needed for semantic similarity analysis."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "DALL-E"
      correct: false
      explain: "DALL-E is specialized for image generation and manipulation, not for text document analysis or semantic similarity tasks."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Embeddings"
      correct: true
      explain: "The embeddings model (text-embedding-ada-002) converts text into numeric vectors that capture semantic meaning, enabling document similarity comparison with minimal development effort."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, needs to build an intelligent course recommendation system that can analyze semantic similarity between course materials, student essays, and training documents. 

Mark, the Machine Learning Engineer, requires a solution that can convert course descriptions, syllabus content, and student submissions into numeric vectors that represent their semantic meaning. These vectors will be used to identify similar courses, detect plagiarism in student work, and recommend relevant training materials based on content similarity. The system must provide consistent, measurable similarity scores and minimize development complexity while handling large volumes of educational content.

Which Azure OpenAI model should Mark use to generate numeric vectors for semantic similarity comparison?
