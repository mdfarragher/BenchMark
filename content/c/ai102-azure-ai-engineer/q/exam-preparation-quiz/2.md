MDFT Pro's training applications need to connect to specific Azure OpenAI deployments optimized for different educational purposes. Claire, a Software Developer at MDFT Pro, is implementing the connection logic for the student assessment application. 

The application must specifically connect to the "Assessment-GPT" deployment rather than the content generation or tutoring deployments. The application needs to make direct REST API calls to ensure it uses the correct model configuration.

What should each educational application use to connect to its appropriate deployment?
