MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, has acquired a large digital library containing 10,000 PDF documents that include various types of educational content: technical textbooks, graphic novels used for creative writing courses, and educational magazines covering industry trends. Claire, the Content Management Director, needs to automatically categorize this diverse collection to improve searchability and organization for students and instructors. 

The PDFs contain scanned books, comics, and magazines that need to be tagged appropriately so the learning management system can recommend appropriate materials based on course type and student preferences. The solution must accurately classify each document while requiring minimal manual development effort.

What type of model should Claire build using Language Studio to categorize these educational materials?
