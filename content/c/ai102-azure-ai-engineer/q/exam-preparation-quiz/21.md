MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, operates a student support chatbot that uses Azure AI Language custom question answering service to help students with course-related inquiries. Mark, the Quality Assurance Manager, needs to ensure the chatbot maintains high accuracy by only providing responses when the system has very high confidence in the answer. 

The current chatbot sometimes provides uncertain or potentially incorrect answers to student questions about course enrollment, prerequisites, and certification requirements. To maintain educational quality standards, the chatbot should only respond when it has at least 95% confidence in the accuracy of its response, ensuring students receive reliable information.

Here is the cURL statement that needs to be completed for testing:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: $LANGUAGE_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"question": "What are the prerequisites for the Azure certification course?", __________ : "0.95"}' '$LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/language/:query-knowledgebases?projectName=StudentSupport&api-version=2021-10-01'
```

What parameter should be used to set the minimum confidence score requirement?
