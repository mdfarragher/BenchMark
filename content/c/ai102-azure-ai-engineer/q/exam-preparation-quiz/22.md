MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, is developing an application to analyze confidential student records and course evaluation documents using Azure AI Language service. Claire, the Privacy Officer, has determined that due to strict data privacy regulations and institutional policies, these sensitive documents containing student information and performance data cannot be sent to the cloud for processing. 

However, the organization still needs to use Azure AI Language capabilities to extract insights, perform sentiment analysis, and categorize the confidential content. The solution must keep all document data on-premises while still leveraging Azure's powerful language processing capabilities through containerized services.

Which three actions should Claire perform in sequence to deploy the Language service container while keeping documents on-premises?
