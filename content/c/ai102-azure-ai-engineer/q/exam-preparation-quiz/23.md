MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, is building a custom Form Recognizer model to automatically process student enrollment forms, course completion certificates, and assessment documents. Mark, the Document Processing Specialist, has collected sample files to train the model for recognizing and extracting information from various educational documents including transcripts, registration forms, and certification paperwork. 

The training dataset needs to meet specific format and size requirements to ensure the model can be successfully trained and deployed for processing the variety of documents that students and instructors submit to the agency.

The sample files available for training are:

| Name  | Type | Size   |
|-------|------|--------|
| File1 | PDF  | 20 MB  |
| File2 | MP4  | 100 MB |
| File3 | JPG  | 20 MB  |
| File4 | PDF  | 100 MB |
| File5 | GIF  | 1 MB   |
| File6 | JPG  | 40 MB  |

Which three files can Mark use to train the Form Recognizer model?
