MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, is developing an intelligent chatbot to assist students with course inquiries and provide information about their comprehensive training programs. Claire, the Chatbot Development Manager, needs the bot to recognize and understand MDFT Pro's specific course names, certification programs, instructor codenames, and proprietary educational methodologies that are unique to their training curriculum. 

These company-specific terms and product names are not recognized by standard language models, but are frequently mentioned by students and staff in conversations. The solution must enable the chatbot to identify these custom entities with minimal development effort while maintaining high accuracy in recognizing MDFT Pro's educational terminology.

Which Azure AI Language service should Claire include in the chatbot solution?
