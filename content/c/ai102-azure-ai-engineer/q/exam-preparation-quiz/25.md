MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, operates a Language Understanding application named "StudentAssistant" for processing student inquiries about courses, schedules, and enrollment. Mark, the DevOps Engineer, needs to deploy this application to a containerized environment to improve scalability and reduce latency for student interactions. 

The application was developed using a Language Understanding authoring resource and has multiple versions with different training and deployment states. Mark needs to identify and deploy the most recent version that is ready for production use in the containerized environment.

The available versions of the StudentAssistant application are:

| Version | Trained Date | Published Date |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| V1.2    | None         | None           |
| V1.1    | 2020-10-01   | None           |
| V1.0    | 2020-09-01   | 2020-09-15     |

Which three actions should Mark perform in sequence to create a container with the latest deployable version?
