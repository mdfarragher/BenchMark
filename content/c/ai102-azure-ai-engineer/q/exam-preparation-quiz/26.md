title: "Configure Azure OpenAI Parameters For Deterministic Responses"
type: "question"
layout: "multiple"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Temperature"
      correct: true
      explain: "Temperature controls randomness in responses - lower values (closer to 0) make responses more deterministic and less creative, while higher values increase creativity."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Top P"
      correct: true
      explain: "Top P (nucleus sampling) controls diversity by limiting token selection - lower values make responses more focused and deterministic."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Max response"
      correct: false
      explain: "Max response tokens controls the length of responses but doesn't affect the deterministic nature or creativity of the content."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Stop sequence"
      correct: false
      explain: "Stop sequences define when to end generation but don't influence the deterministic behavior or creativity of the response content."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "Frequency penalty"
      correct: false
      explain: "Frequency penalty reduces repetition of tokens but doesn't directly control deterministic behavior or creativity levels."
    - id: "answer6"
      title: "Presence penalty"
      correct: false
      explain: "Presence penalty encourages topic diversity but doesn't primarily control deterministic versus creative response generation."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, has built a student support chatbot using Azure OpenAI Studio to provide consistent, accurate answers to frequently asked questions about course policies, enrollment procedures, and certification requirements. Claire, the Educational Technology Manager, has received feedback that the chatbot's responses vary significantly when students ask the same questions, leading to confusion about official policies and procedures. 

Some responses are creative and conversational while others are formal and factual, creating inconsistency in the student experience. The chatbot needs to provide more predictable, standardized responses that align with MDFT Pro's educational standards and policy documentation.

Which two parameters should Claire configure to make the chatbot responses more deterministic and less creative?
