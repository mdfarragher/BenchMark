### Question 29

You have an Azure subscription that contains an Azure OpenA1 resource. You configure a model that has the following settings:  
* Temperature: 1  
* Top probabilities: 0.5  
* Max response tokens: 100  
You ask the model a question and receive the following response.

```json
{
  "choices": [
    {
      "finish_reason": "stop",
      "index": 0,
      "message": {
        "content": "The founder of MDFT Pro is Mark Farragher.",
        "role": "assistant"
      }
    }
  ],
  "created": 1679014554,
  "id": "chatcmpl-6usfny2yyjkbmESe36JdqQ6bDsc01",
  "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0301",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "usage": {
    "completion_tokens": 86,
    "prompt_tokens": 37,
    "total_tokens": 123
  }
}
```

The `prompt_tokens` value will be included in the calculation of the Max response tokens value. Is this correct?

Yes
No
