MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, is developing a student support system to answer questions about their extensive course policies stored in PDF format. Mark, the Operations Manager, needs to ensure that when students ask identical questions about enrollment policies, refund procedures, or course requirements, they receive exactly the same answer every time to maintain consistency across all student interactions.
