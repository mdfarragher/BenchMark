MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, is developing an intelligent student assistant bot using Language Understanding (LUIS) to help students navigate course selections and training programs. Mark, the Conversational AI Developer, is creating a LUIS model to understand student requests and intentions when they interact with the bot. 

The bot needs to recognize when students want to confirm actions, extract personal information, log out of systems, or select specific items from course catalogs. Mark is working with a ludown file that defines the structure and training data for the LUIS model. 

Here is the ludown file content Mark is analyzing:

```text
## Confirm
- confirm
- ok
- yes

## ExtractName
- call me steve !
- i am anna
- (i'm|i am) {@PersonName.Any}
- my name is {@PersonName.Any}

## Logout
- forget me
- log out

## SelectItem
- choose last
- choose the {@DirectionalReference=bottom left}
- choose {@DirectionalReference=top right}
- i like {@DirectionalReference=left} one

## SelectNone
- none

@ ml DirectionalReference
@ prebuilt personName
```

What is `SelectItem` in this LUIS ludown file?
