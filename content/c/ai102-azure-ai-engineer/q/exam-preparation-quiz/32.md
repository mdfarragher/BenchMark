MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, is building a sophisticated student support bot using Language Understanding (LUIS) to help students interact naturally with their learning management system. Claire, the Natural Language Processing Specialist, is analyzing the training data structure to ensure the bot can properly understand various ways students might express their requests. 

The ludown file contains different types of components that work together to train the LUIS model to recognize student intentions and extract relevant information from their natural language inputs.

Here is the ludown file content Claire is examining:

```text
## Confirm
- confirm
- ok
- yes

## ExtractName
- call me steve !
- i am anna
- (i'm|i am) {@PersonName.Any}
- my name is {@PersonName.Any}

## Logout
- forget me
- log out

## SelectItem
- choose last
- choose the {@DirectionalReference=bottom left}
- choose {@DirectionalReference=top right}
- i like {@DirectionalReference=left} one

## SelectNone
- none

@ ml DirectionalReference
@ prebuilt personName
```

What is `choose {@DirectionalReference=top right}` in this LUIS ludown file?
