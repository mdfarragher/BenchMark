MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, is developing an automated call handling system for their international student support hotline. Mark, the Customer Experience Manager, needs to implement a solution that can automatically detect whether incoming callers are speaking French or English, and then respond appropriately in the caller's language. 

The system must be able to identify the language being spoken, understand the caller's inquiry, and provide responses in the same language to ensure effective communication with students from both English and French-speaking regions. This multilingual support is crucial for maintaining high-quality customer service across MDFT Pro's diverse international student base.

Which two Azure AI services should Mark use to meet the language detection and response requirements?
