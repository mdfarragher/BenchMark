MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, is building an intelligent chatbot to help students access information from their comprehensive knowledge base containing course details, enrollment procedures, certification requirements, and frequently asked questions. Claire, the Bot Development Lead, needs to configure the chatbot to seamlessly query this knowledge base and provide accurate answers to student inquiries. 

The knowledge base has been created using QnA Maker and contains hundreds of question-answer pairs covering all aspects of MDFT Pro's training programs. The chatbot must be able to search this knowledge base efficiently and return relevant answers to student questions in real-time.

Which dialog class should Claire use to enable the chatbot to query the QnA Maker knowledge base?
