      title: "Yes"
      correct: true
      explain: "Azure Face API supports person groups with up to 10,000 people, so the code can handle a group of 10,000 students without exceeding service limits."

      title: "No"
      correct: false
      explain: "The Face API does support person groups up to 10,000 people, making this scale feasible for the student recognition system."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Only with multiple person groups"
      correct: false
      explain: "A single person group can accommodate 10,000 people, so multiple groups are not required for this use case."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, operates a large campus with over 10,000 students enrolled in various certification programs and training courses. Claire, the Campus Security Director, is evaluating whether their planned student recognition system using Azure Face API can scale to handle their entire student population. 

The system would use a single person group to store face data for all students, enabling automatic identification during campus entry, classroom attendance tracking, and facility access control. Claire needs to determine if the Face API can support this scale of operation before proceeding with the full implementation.

Here is the code being evaluated for scalability:

```csharp
static async void AddFace(string subscription_key, string
personGroupId, string personId, string imageURI)
{
    var client = new HttpClient();
    client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key", subscription_key);
    var endpointURI = $"https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/face/v1.0/persongroups/{personGroupId}/persons/{personId}/persistedFaces";
    HttpResponseMessage response;
    var body = "{ \"url\": \"" + imageURI + "\"}";
    var content = new StringContent(body, Encoding.UTF8, "application/json");
    response = await client.PostAsync(endpointURI, content);
}
```

Will this code work for a person group containing 10,000 students?
