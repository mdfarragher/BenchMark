MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, is implementing a comprehensive student recognition system that needs to accurately identify students in various scenarios: classroom attendance, library access, cafeteria entry, and campus security checkpoints. 

Mark, the Biometric Systems Engineer, wants to improve recognition accuracy by storing multiple photos of each student - including their official ID photo, a front-facing classroom photo, and photos taken from different angles during orientation sessions. This multi-image approach should help the system recognize students even when they're wearing glasses, have different hairstyles, or are photographed from various angles.

Here is the Face API code being used:

```csharp
static async void AddFace(string subscription_key, string
personGroupId, string personId, string imageURI)
{
    var client = new HttpClient();
    client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key", subscription_key);
    var endpointURI = $"https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/face/v1.0/persongroups/{personGroupId}/persons/{personId}/persistedFaces";
    HttpResponseMessage response;
    var body = "{ \"url\": \"" + imageURI + "\"}";
    var content = new StringContent(body, Encoding.UTF8, "application/json");
    response = await client.PostAsync(endpointURI, content);
}
```

Can the `AddFace` method be called multiple times to add multiple face images to the same student's person object?
