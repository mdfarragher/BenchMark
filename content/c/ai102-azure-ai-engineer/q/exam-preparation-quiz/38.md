title: "Choose Appropriate Variable Scope In Bot Framework Composer"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "dialog"
      correct: true
      explain: "Dialog scope variables are disposed when the dialog ends, making it perfect for temporary data like names that should not persist beyond the current conversation flow."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "user"
      correct: false
      explain: "User scope persists across all conversations with that specific user, which is unnecessary for temporary input that should be cleared when the dialog ends."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "turn"
      correct: false
      explain: "Turn scope only lasts for a single conversation turn, which is too short-lived for data that might be used throughout a dialog sequence."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "conversation"
      correct: false
      explain: "Conversation scope persists throughout the entire bot conversation, which would retain the name longer than needed and not dispose when the dialog ends."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, is building a comprehensive student support chatbot using Microsoft Bot Framework Composer to help students with course enrollment, schedule inquiries, and account management. Claire, the Chatbot Architect, is designing a dialog called "StudentDetails" that collects student information during the enrollment process. 

The dialog contains a TextInput control that prompts students for their name, and this name data should be temporarily stored during the dialog interaction but automatically cleaned up when the enrollment process is complete to maintain data privacy and system efficiency.

Which variable scope should Claire assign to the "name" property to ensure it gets disposed when the StudentDetails dialog ends?
