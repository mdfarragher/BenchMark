MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, operates a student support chatbot that uses QnA Maker to answer frequently asked questions about courses, enrollment, and certification requirements. Mark, the Knowledge Base Manager, has enabled active learning for their QnA Maker application to improve the chatbot's ability to handle student inquiries. 

The system has been collecting questions from real student interactions where the chatbot couldn't provide satisfactory answers. Now Mark needs to integrate these user-generated insights back into the knowledge base to enhance the chatbot's performance and ensure it can better serve future student questions.

Which four actions should Mark perform in sequence to integrate user input into the QnA Maker model through active learning?
