MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, has recorded a comprehensive 20-GB training session video file named "CourseContent.avi" that contains multiple instructional modules. Claire, the Content Manager at MDFT Pro, needs to make this educational content searchable and accessible to students by extracting key insights, generating transcripts, and identifying topics discussed throughout the video.
