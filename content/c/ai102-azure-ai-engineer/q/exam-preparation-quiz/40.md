MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, is expanding their course offerings to Spanish and Portuguese-speaking markets and needs to automatically translate course descriptions and training materials. Claire, the International Content Manager, is building a REST endpoint that will generate multilingual product descriptions for their training courses. 

The system needs to translate English course content into both Spanish (es) and Portuguese (pt) to support students in Latin American markets. Claire requires the correct Translator service endpoint to ensure optimal performance and compliance for their North American-based operations.

The REST endpoint needs to be completed with the correct base URL:

```
__________/translate?api-version=3.0&to=es&to=pt
```

Which endpoint should Claire use for the Translator service?
