layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "machine learned"
      correct: true
      explain: "Machine learned entities are ideal for complex, contextual information like addresses that can vary significantly in format and structure, allowing the model to learn patterns from examples."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "regex"
      correct: false
      explain: "Regex entities work well for fixed patterns but addresses have too much variation in format and structure to be effectively captured by regular expressions."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "geographyV2"
      correct: false
      explain: "GeographyV2 entities recognize geographical locations but don't capture complete address structures including street numbers, apartment details, and postal codes."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Pattern.any"
      correct: false
      explain: "Pattern.any entities extract variable-length data but are better suited for simple extraction rather than complex structured information like full addresses."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "list"
      correct: false
      explain: "List entities work with predefined sets of values, but student addresses are unique and can't be pre-enumerated in a list format."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, is building a comprehensive student enrollment system using Language Understanding (LUIS) to process natural language requests from prospective students. Claire, the Enrollment Systems Developer, needs to capture student billing addresses from conversational inputs where students provide their address information in various formats such as "I live at 123 Main Street, Apartment 4B, Springfield, IL 62701" or "My address is 456 Oak Avenue, Unit 2, Chicago Illinois 60614". 

The system must be flexible enough to handle different address formats, including international addresses, apartment numbers, suite information, and various ways people naturally express their location details.

Which entity type should Claire use to capture the complex billing address information in the LUIS model?
