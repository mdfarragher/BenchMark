layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Yes"
      correct: true
      explain: "The /status endpoint does query the Azure backend to verify the validity of the API key and billing configuration when the container starts and periodically during operation."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "No"
      correct: false
      explain: "The status endpoint actively validates the API key against the Azure service to ensure proper authentication and billing tracking for the containerized service."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Only during container startup"
      correct: false
      explain: "While validation occurs at startup, the container may also periodically check the API key validity during operation through the status endpoint."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Only with internet connectivity"
      correct: false
      explain: "Although internet connectivity is required for Azure validation, the question asks specifically about the status endpoint behavior, which does verify API key validity."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, is deploying Azure Text Analytics containers on their on-premises infrastructure to analyze student feedback and course evaluations while keeping sensitive data within their private network. 

Mark, the Container Operations Specialist, is setting up sentiment analysis containers to process student survey responses and needs to understand how the containerized services validate their connection to Azure for billing and authentication purposes. The deployment uses Docker containers with proper API keys and billing endpoints configured, and Mark wants to verify that the container can properly authenticate with Azure services.

Here is the Docker command being used:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 --memory 10g --cpus 2 \
mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/textanalytics/sentiment \
Eula=accept \
Billing={ENDPOINT_URI} \
ApiKey={API_KEY}
```

When accessing http://localhost:5000/status, does this endpoint query the Azure backend to verify whether the API key is valid?
