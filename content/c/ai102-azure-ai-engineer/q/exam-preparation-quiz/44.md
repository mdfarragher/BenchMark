MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, is implementing Azure Text Analytics containers in their on-premises environment to analyze student course feedback while maintaining data privacy. Claire, the IT Operations Manager, needs to understand the logging capabilities of the containerized sentiment analysis service to ensure proper monitoring, troubleshooting, and compliance with their data governance policies. 

The containers are being deployed to process thousands of student evaluation responses, and Claire wants to confirm that the system will capture appropriate operational data for auditing and performance monitoring without requiring additional logging infrastructure setup.

Here is the Docker command being executed:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 --memory 10g --cpus 2 \
mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/textanalytics/sentiment \
Eula=accept \
Billing={ENDPOINT_URI} \
ApiKey={API_KEY}
```

Will the container logging provider write log data during operation?
