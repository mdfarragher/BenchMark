MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, has deployed Azure Text Analytics containers for processing student feedback and course evaluations. Mark, the Integration Developer, is building applications that need to interact with the containerized sentiment analysis service and requires comprehensive documentation of the available API endpoints, request formats, response structures, and parameter options. 

The development team needs to understand the complete API specification to build robust integrations that can effectively process student survey data and generate meaningful insights for course improvement initiatives.

Here is the Docker command for the container deployment:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 --memory 10g --cpus 2 \
mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/textanalytics/sentiment \
Eula=accept \
Billing={ENDPOINT_URI} \
ApiKey={API_KEY}
```

Will accessing http://localhost:5000/swagger provide detailed documentation for the available API endpoints?
