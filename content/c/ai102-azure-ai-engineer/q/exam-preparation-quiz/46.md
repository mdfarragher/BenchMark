MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, wants to create a specialized AI model for generating personalized course recommendations and study guidance tailored to their specific educational methodology and course catalog. Claire, the AI Model Developer, has collected 500 prompt-completion pairs from successful student interactions, course advisor conversations, and effective study recommendations that represent the ideal responses MDFT Pro wants their AI system to provide. 

These training examples include prompts like "What certification should I pursue for cloud computing?" paired with completions that recommend specific MDFT Pro courses, prerequisites, and career pathways. Claire needs to prepare this training data in the correct format for Azure OpenAI fine-tuning to create a custom model that understands MDFT Pro's educational approach.

Which format should Claire use for the training data file containing the 500 prompt-completion pairs?
