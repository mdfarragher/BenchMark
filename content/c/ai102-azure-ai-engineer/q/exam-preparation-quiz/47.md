MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, receives hundreds of lesson plans from instructors teaching various certification courses and professional development programs. Mark, the Curriculum Operations Manager, needs to implement an automated system that can analyze these submitted lesson plans and extract key information such as lesson times, duration, required textbooks, prerequisite materials, learning objectives, and assessment methods. 

The lesson plans come in various formats including PDFs, Word documents, and scanned images, and contain both structured and semi-structured information that needs to be systematically extracted for course scheduling, resource planning, and curriculum management purposes.

Which Azure service should Mark use to analyze lesson plans and extract key fields like lesson times and required texts?
