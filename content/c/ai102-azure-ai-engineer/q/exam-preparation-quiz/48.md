MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, is developing an enhanced language learning platform for international students who are learning English while pursuing technical certifications. Claire, the Learning Experience Designer, wants to implement a feature that automatically analyzes course content and provides students with relevant pictures that represent commonly used words and phrases in the text. 

This visual learning aid would help students better understand technical terminology and concepts by associating them with visual representations. The solution needs to integrate seamlessly with existing course materials and require minimal development effort while providing immediate visual context to improve comprehension for students with varying English proficiency levels.
