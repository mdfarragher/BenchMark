title: "Improve Azure OpenAI Responses With Better User Prompts"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Yes"
      correct: true
      explain: "Adding contextual information like 'in the context of AI models' helps the AI understand the specific domain and provide more accurate, relevant answers rather than generic responses."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "No"
      correct: false
      explain: "More specific and contextual prompts typically improve AI response quality by providing clearer guidance about the expected scope and domain of the answer."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Only for technical terms"
      correct: false
      explain: "Adding context improves responses for all types of queries, not just technical terms, by helping the AI understand the intended scope and domain."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Only with system message changes"
      correct: false
      explain: "User prompt improvements can enhance response quality independently of system message modifications, though both can work together effectively."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, is building an AI-powered educational assistant to help students understand various technology concepts and terminology. Mark, the Educational Content Developer, is implementing an Azure OpenAI-based application that provides definitions and explanations of common AI and technology terms. 

However, the current implementation is producing generic or unhelpful answers when students ask about technical terminology. The AI assistant needs to provide clear, educational responses that are specifically relevant to the technology and AI learning context rather than broad, general definitions that may not be useful for students studying for certification exams.

Here is the current code implementation:

```csharp
...
OpenAIClient client =
    new OpenAIClient(new Uri(endpoint), new AzureKeyCredential(key));
ChatCompletionsOptions options = new ChatCompletionsOptions
{
    Messages =
    {
        new ChatMessage(ChatRole.System, "You are a helpful assistant."),
        new ChatMessage(ChatRole.User, "What is an LLM?")
    }
};

ChatCompletions response = client.GetChatCompletions(
    deploymentName, options);
ChatMessage completion = response.Choices[0].Message;
Console.WriteLine($"Chatbot: {completion.Content}");
...
```

Will changing the user prompt from "What is an LLM?" to "What is an LLM in the context of AI models?" improve the quality of the answer?
