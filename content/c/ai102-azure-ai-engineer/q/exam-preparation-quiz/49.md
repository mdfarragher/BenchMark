### Question 49

You are building an app that will provide users with definitions of common AI terms.  
You create the following C# code.

```csharp
...
OpenAIClient client =
    new OpenAIClient(new Uri(endpoint), new AzureKeyCredential(key));
ChatCompletionsOptions options = new ChatCompletionsOptions
{
    Messages =
    {
        new ChatMessage(ChatRole.System, "You are a helpful assistant."),
        new ChatMessage(ChatRole.User, "What is an LLM?")
    }
};

ChatCompletions response = client.GetChatCompletions(
    deploymentName, options);
ChatMessage completion = response.Choices[0].Message;
Console.WriteLine($"Chatbot: {completion.Content}");
...
```

The code is producing unhelpful answers. You decide to change the user prompt "What is an LLM?" to "What is an LLM in the context of AI models?".

Will this improve the quality of the answer? 

Yes
No

answer: yes
