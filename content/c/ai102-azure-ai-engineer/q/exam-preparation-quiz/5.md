MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, is developing a training portal webpage that will display videos of instructor sessions using the Azure Video Indexer service. Mark, the Technical Director, needs to embed both the Player widget and the Cognitive Insights widget into the page. 

The solution must allow students to search for specific topics discussed in the training sessions, display instructor names and faces for identification, and show English captions for accessibility. The widgets need to be properly configured with the correct URL parameters to meet these educational requirements.

Here is the URL template that needs to be completed:

```
https://www.videoindexer.ai/embed/insights/<accountId>/<videoId>/?widgets=__________&controls=__________
```

Which two parameters should be added to configure the widgets correctly?
