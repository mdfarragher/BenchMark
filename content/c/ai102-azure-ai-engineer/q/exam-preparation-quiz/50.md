title: "Enhance Azure OpenAI Responses With Better System Messages"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Yes"
      correct: true
      explain: "Adding domain-specific context to the system message constrains the AI's responses to focus on AI language models, resulting in more relevant and accurate answers within that specific domain."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "No"
      correct: false
      explain: "More specific system messages that define the AI's role and context typically improve response quality by providing clearer guidelines for appropriate responses."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Only for complex queries"
      correct: false
      explain: "Improved system messages enhance response quality for all types of queries by establishing better context and boundaries, not just complex ones."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Only when combined with user prompt changes"
      correct: false
      explain: "System message improvements can enhance response quality independently, though they work even better when combined with well-crafted user prompts."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, is developing an AI-powered study assistant that helps students understand technical concepts for certification exams. Claire, the AI Application Developer, is working on improving the quality and relevance of responses from their Azure OpenAI-based educational tool. 

The current system provides generic answers that may not be focused enough on the specific educational domain, and Claire wants to ensure the AI assistant provides responses that are specifically tailored to AI and machine learning concepts relevant to student learning objectives rather than broad, general information that might confuse students or provide irrelevant details.

Here is the current code implementation:

```csharp
...
OpenAIClient client =
    new OpenAIClient(new Uri(endpoint), new AzureKeyCredential(key));
ChatCompletionsOptions options = new ChatCompletionsOptions
{
    Messages =
    {
        new ChatMessage(ChatRole.System, "You are a helpful assistant."),
        new ChatMessage(ChatRole.User, "What is an LLM?")
    }
};

ChatCompletions response = client.GetChatCompletions(
    deploymentName, options);
ChatMessage completion = response.Choices[0].Message;
Console.WriteLine($"Chatbot: {completion.Content}");
...
```

Will changing the system prompt from "You are a helpful assistant" to "You are a helpful assistant. You must answer only within the context of AI language models" improve the quality of the answer?
