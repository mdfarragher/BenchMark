### Question 50

You are building an app that will provide users with definitions of common AI terms.  
You create the following C# code.

```csharp
...
OpenAIClient client =
    new OpenAIClient(new Uri(endpoint), new AzureKeyCredential(key));
ChatCompletionsOptions options = new ChatCompletionsOptions
{
    Messages =
    {
        new ChatMessage(ChatRole.System, "You are a helpful assistant."),
        new ChatMessage(ChatRole.User, "What is an LLM?")
    }
};

ChatCompletions response = client.GetChatCompletions(
    deploymentName, options);
ChatMessage completion = response.Choices[0].Message;
Console.WriteLine($"Chatbot: {completion.Content}");
...
```

The code is producing unhelpful answers. You decide to change the system prompt "You are a helpful assistant" to "You are a helpful assistant. You must answer only within the context of AI language models".

Will this improve the quality of the answer? 

Yes
No

answer: yes
