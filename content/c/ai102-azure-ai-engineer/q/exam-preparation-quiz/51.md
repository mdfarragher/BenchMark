MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, has developed five specialized chatbots using Microsoft Bot Framework Composer to support different aspects of student services: course enrollment, technical support, career guidance, certification tracking, and general inquiries. 

Mark, the Student Experience Manager, needs to create a unified bot interface that can intelligently route student conversations to the appropriate specialized bot based on their initial questions and ongoing conversation context. The solution must dynamically determine which bot should handle each interaction without requiring students to manually select a specific service category.

Which three actions should Mark perform to combine the bots with dynamic routing capabilities?
