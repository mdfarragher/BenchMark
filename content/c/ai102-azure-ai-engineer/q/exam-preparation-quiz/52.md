MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, is developing a chatbot to help new students set up their learning environment and configure their study tools. Claire, the Digital Learning Specialist, needs to implement a dialog system that guides students through a multi-step process including account verification, learning preference selection, course enrollment, study schedule setup, and notification preferences. 

The process must ensure that each step is completed before moving to the next, and students should be able to provide information in a specific sequence to complete their profile setup successfully.

Which type of dialog should Claire use to implement this guided setup process?
