MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, has deployed an AI-powered student support chatbot that uses Azure OpenAI to provide personalized learning assistance and Azure AI Content Safety to ensure appropriate interactions. Mark, the AI Safety Coordinator, needs to fine-tune the content filter configurations to balance student safety with educational effectiveness. 

The current filters are either too restrictive, blocking legitimate educational discussions about sensitive topics, or too permissive, allowing potentially inappropriate content. Mark wants to test various filter settings using sample student questions and educational scenarios to optimize the balance between safety and functionality.

Does using the Moderate text content feature in Content Safety Studio meet the requirement for optimizing content filter configurations?
