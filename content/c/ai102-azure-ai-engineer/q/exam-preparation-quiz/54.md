title: "Reduce Azure Cognitive Search Query Throttling By Adding Indexes"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Yes"
      correct: false
      explain: "Adding more indexes increases resource consumption and can actually worsen throttling issues if the underlying service tier lacks sufficient capacity."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "No"
      correct: true
      explain: "Query throttling is caused by insufficient search units or service tier limitations, not by the number of indexes. Upgrading the service tier or adding search units would address the root cause."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Only if indexes are partitioned"
      correct: false
      explain: "Index partitioning doesn't resolve throttling caused by service tier capacity limitations and may add complexity without addressing the core issue."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Only if indexes use different schemas"
      correct: false
      explain: "Schema differences between indexes don't impact query throttling, which is fundamentally a capacity and service tier limitation issue."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, operates an Azure Cognitive Search service to help students find relevant course materials, certification resources, and training documentation across their extensive digital library. Over the past 12 months, student enrollment has grown significantly, leading to a steady increase in search query volume as more students access the learning platform. 

Claire, the Learning Technology Manager, has discovered that some student search requests are being throttled during peak study periods, causing delays in accessing critical learning materials and negatively impacting the student experience.

Does adding more indexes to the Azure Cognitive Search service reduce the likelihood that search query requests will be throttled?
