MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, is developing a student communication platform that includes discussion forums, messaging capabilities, and user-generated content submissions. Mark, the Community Safety Manager, needs to implement Content Moderator service to automatically detect and filter inappropriate messages that contain sexually explicit language or adult content. 

The system must identify the severity level of adult content in messages using numerical scores to determine appropriate moderation actions, from simple warnings to content blocking, ensuring a safe learning environment for students of all ages.
