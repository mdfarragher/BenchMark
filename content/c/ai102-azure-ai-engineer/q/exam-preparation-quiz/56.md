MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, has implemented Azure Content Moderator in their online learning platform to monitor student-generated content and discussion forum messages. Claire, the Platform Safety Specialist, is configuring the content filtering system to automatically categorize messages based on their adult content levels. 

The system needs to distinguish between different severity levels of inappropriate content to apply appropriate moderation actions: level 1 content might receive a warning, level 2 might be flagged for review, while level 3 content should be immediately blocked and reported to administrators for further investigation.

Which category level will Content Moderator assign to messages that contain sexually explicit language?
