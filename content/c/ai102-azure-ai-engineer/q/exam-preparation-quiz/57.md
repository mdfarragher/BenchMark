MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, is building a comprehensive student assessment platform that processes sensitive academic records, performance data, and personal learning analytics using Azure AI Language service. 

Mark, the Security Architecture Manager, needs to ensure that the Language service can only be accessed by specific Azure resources within their learning management system infrastructure, such as their web applications, data processing functions, and analytics services. The solution must prevent unauthorized access from external sources while maintaining optimal performance and requiring minimal ongoing security administration.

What should Mark include in the solution to ensure only specific Azure processes can access the Language service?
