MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, has developed a chatbot using Microsoft Bot Framework Composer to facilitate student course purchases, certification exam registrations, and training material orders. Mark, the E-commerce Integration Specialist, needs to ensure that students can easily cancel their transactions at any point during the purchase process, whether they're enrolling in courses, buying study materials, or registering for certification exams. 

The solution must handle cancellation requests gracefully, restore the conversation to a neutral state, and provide students with clear confirmation that their transaction has been cancelled, all while minimizing the amount of custom code required.

What should Mark add to the bot to enable users to cancel in-progress transactions with minimal development effort?
