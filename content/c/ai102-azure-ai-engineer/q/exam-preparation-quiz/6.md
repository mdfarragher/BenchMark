MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, is developing a comprehensive training portal that displays instructor-led sessions using Azure Video Indexer. Claire, the Digital Learning Specialist, needs to configure the Player widget to ensure accessibility for all students. 

The training videos must display English captions to support students who are deaf, hard of hearing, or prefer reading along with the audio content. The player widget URL needs specific parameters to enable caption functionality for the educational platform.

Here is the player widget URL template that needs to be completed:

```
https://www.videoindexer.ai/embed/player/<accountId>/<videoId>/?showcaptions=__________&captions=__________
```

Which two parameters should be configured to show English (United States) captions?
