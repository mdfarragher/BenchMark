MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, is developing an automated document analysis system for their technical certification programs across various industries including cloud computing, cybersecurity, data science, and software development. 

Claire, the Curriculum Content Manager, needs to implement a solution that can automatically scan training materials, study guides, and certification exam preparation documents to identify and extract industry-specific technical terms, product names, certification titles, and specialized terminology unique to each field. The system must accurately distinguish between general vocabulary and domain-specific technical language to help organize content and create specialized glossaries for students.
