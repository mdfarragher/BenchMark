MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, is developing a multilingual learning platform that allows international students to interact with course content in their native languages. Claire, the International Programs Manager, needs to implement a speech translation feature that converts English instructor lectures to Italian for their growing Italian student population. 

The application must properly configure the Azure Speech service to recognize English speech input before translating it to Italian, ensuring accurate language processing and high-quality translations for the educational content.

```python
speech_translation_config = speechsdk.translation.SpeechTranslationConfig(subscription=os.environ.get('SPEECH_KEY'), region=os.environ.get('SPEECH_REGION'))
speech_translation_config.__________ = "en-US"
speech_translation_config.add_target_language("it")
audio_config = speechsdk.audio.AudioConfig(use_default_microphone=True)
recognizer = speechsdk.translation.TranslationRecognizer(translation_config=speech_translation_config, audio_config=audio_config)
```

How should Claire complete the first placeholder to specify the source language for speech recognition?
