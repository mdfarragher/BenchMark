MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, is expanding their global reach by implementing real-time speech translation capabilities in their virtual classroom platform. Mark, the Technology Integration Specialist, needs to configure the Azure Speech Translation service to support multiple target languages for international students. 

The platform should be able to translate English instructor presentations into various languages including Italian, Spanish, and French, allowing students to select their preferred language for real-time translation during live sessions and recorded lectures.

```python
speech_translation_config = speechsdk.translation.SpeechTranslationConfig(subscription=os.environ.get('SPEECH_KEY'), region=os.environ.get('SPEECH_REGION'))
speech_translation_config.speech_recognition_language = "en-US"
speech_translation_config.__________("it")
audio_config = speechsdk.audio.AudioConfig(use_default_microphone=True)
recognizer = speechsdk.translation.TranslationRecognizer(translation_config=speech_translation_config, audio_config=audio_config)
```

How should Mark complete the second placeholder to specify Italian as a target language for translation?
