MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, has deployed a Microsoft Bot Framework chatbot to assist students with course information, enrollment processes, and technical support. Mark, the Voice Technology Specialist, needs to enable voice interaction capabilities so students can speak with the bot through various client applications including their mobile learning app, desktop study companion, and web-based virtual classroom platform. 

The solution must provide consistent voice interaction functionality across all these different client applications while maintaining a single bot implementation for easier management and updates.

Which type of channel should Mark use to enable voice interactions that support multiple client applications?
