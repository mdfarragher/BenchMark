title: "Move Custom Vision Object Detection Model Between Environments"
type: "question"
layout: "multiple"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Use the GetProjects endpoint on acvdev"
      correct: true
      explain: "GetProjects retrieves project information from the development environment, providing the necessary project details required for the export process."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Use the ExportProject endpoint on acvdev"
      correct: true
      explain: "ExportProject creates a portable representation of the entire project including the model, training data, and configuration that can be imported into another environment."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Use the ImportProject endpoint on acvprod"
      correct: true
      explain: "ImportProject takes the exported project data and recreates the project with its trained model in the production environment."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Use the ExportIteration endpoint on acvdev"
      correct: false
      explain: "ExportIteration exports only a specific model iteration for deployment, not the complete project structure needed for environment migration."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "Use the GetIterations endpoint on acvdev"
      correct: false
      explain: "GetIterations retrieves information about model iterations but doesn't export the model or project data for migration."
    - id: "answer6"
      title: "Use the UpdateProject endpoint on acvprod"
      correct: false
      explain: "UpdateProject modifies existing project settings but doesn't import or create new projects from external sources."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, has been developing computer vision capabilities to automatically analyze student engagement and attention during online classes. Claire, the Learning Analytics Manager, has successfully created and trained an object detection model called "EngagementTracker" in their development Custom Vision resource (cvdev) within a project called "StudentAnalytics". 

The model can identify various student behaviors and engagement indicators during video sessions. Now that the model has been thoroughly tested and validated, Claire needs to move it from the development environment to their production Custom Vision resource (cvprod) to begin analyzing real student interactions in live classrooms.

Which three actions should Claire perform in sequence to move the object detection model to the production environment?
