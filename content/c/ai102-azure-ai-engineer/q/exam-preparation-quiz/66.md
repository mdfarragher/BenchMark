MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, has developed a custom question answering system using Azure Cognitive Service for Language to help students navigate complex certification requirements and course pathways. Mark, the Student Support Technology Manager, wants to enhance the chatbot experience so that when students ask about a certification program, the bot can naturally guide them through related follow-up topics such as prerequisites, study materials, exam scheduling, and career outcomes. 

Instead of requiring students to ask separate, unrelated questions, the system should provide contextual follow-up options that create a conversational flow from general inquiries to specific actionable information.

What should Mark do to configure the project for multi-turn conversations?
