MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, is developing an advanced document processing system for their corporate training materials using Azure Cognitive Search. Claire, the Content Intelligence Manager, has created a custom skill that analyzes training documents to extract company information and generate detailed descriptions about organizations mentioned in the content. 

The custom skill processes company names found in documents and returns enriched information including company descriptions, industry classifications, and relevant training contexts that will help students better understand the business scenarios presented in case studies and certification materials.

```json
{
  "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Skills.Custom.WebApiSkill",
  "description": "Extract company information and generate descriptions",
  "uri": "https://mdftpro-webskill.azurewebsites.net/api/process",
  "context": "/document/organizations/*",
  "inputs": [
    {
      "name": "companyName",
      "source": "/document/organizations/*"
    }
  ],
  "outputs": [
    {
      "name": "companyDescription"
    }
  ]
}
```

Is the `companyDescription` output available for indexing in the search solution?
