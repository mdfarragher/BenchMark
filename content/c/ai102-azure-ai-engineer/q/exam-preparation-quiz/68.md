MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, has implemented an Azure Cognitive Search solution to process their extensive library of business case studies and training materials. Mark, the Search Architecture Specialist, has designed a custom skill that integrates with their proprietary company database API to enrich documents with additional business context and industry insights. 

The skill takes company names extracted from training documents and calls an external web service to retrieve comprehensive company profiles, financial data, and industry analysis that enhances the learning experience by providing students with real-world context about the organizations featured in their coursework.

```json
{
  "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Skills.Custom.WebApiSkill",
  "description": "Enrich company data via external API",
  "uri": "https://mdftpro-webskill.azurewebsites.net/api/process",
  "context": "/document/organizations/*",
  "inputs": [
    {
      "name": "companyName",
      "source": "/document/organizations/*"
    }
  ],
  "outputs": [
    {
      "name": "companyDescription"
    }
  ]
}
```

Does this custom skill definition call a web API as part of the enrichment process?
