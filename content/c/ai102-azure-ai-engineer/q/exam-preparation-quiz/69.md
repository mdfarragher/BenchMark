### Question 69

You are building an Azure Cognitive Search custom skill.  
You have the following custom skill schema definition.

```json
{
  "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Skills.Custom.WebApiSkill",
  "description": "My custom skill description",
  "uri": "https://contoso-webskill.azurewebsites.net/api/process",
  "context": "/document/organizations/*",
  "inputs": [
    {
      "name": "companyName",
      "source": "/document/organizations/*"
    }
  ],
  "outputs": [
    {
      "name": "companyDescription"
    }
  ]
}

```

The enrichment step is called only for the first organization under `/documents/organizations`. Is this correct?
