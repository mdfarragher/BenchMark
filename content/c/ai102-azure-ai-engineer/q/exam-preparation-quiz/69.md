MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, processes corporate case study documents that often mention multiple companies and organizations throughout their training materials. Claire, the Document Processing Specialist, has implemented a custom skill to extract and enrich information about all organizations mentioned in these educational documents. 

The skill is designed to analyze business case studies that typically reference several companies, partners, competitors, and industry players, ensuring that students receive comprehensive context about all organizations involved in the business scenarios rather than missing important entities that appear later in the document content.

```json
{
  "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Skills.Custom.WebApiSkill",
  "description": "Process all organizations in document",
  "uri": "https://mdftpro-webskill.azurewebsites.net/api/process",
  "context": "/document/organizations/*",
  "inputs": [
    {
      "name": "companyName",
      "source": "/document/organizations/*"
    }
  ],
  "outputs": [
    {
      "name": "companyDescription"
    }
  ]
}
```

Is the enrichment step called only for the first organization under `/document/organizations`?
