MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, has developed a comprehensive student support chatbot that combines structured knowledge base answers with intelligent conversation handling. Mark, the Conversational AI Architect, has already implemented a QnA Maker resource containing frequently asked questions about courses, certifications, and policies, as well as a bot built with Azure Bot Framework SDK for conversational flow management. 

However, the current implementation can only handle simple question-and-answer scenarios and needs to be enhanced with intelligent routing capabilities to handle both factual inquiries and more complex conversational intents like booking consultations, understanding student sentiment, and providing personalized learning recommendations.

What additional component should Mark add to meet the technical requirements for intelligent conversation routing?
