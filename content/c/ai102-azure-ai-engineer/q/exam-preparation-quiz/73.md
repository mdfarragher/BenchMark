MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, has received a collection of historical handwritten letters and documents from industry pioneers and educational leaders that contain valuable insights about early professional development practices and certification programs. 

Claire, the Digital Archive Specialist, needs to make this content searchable and accessible to researchers and students studying the evolution of professional training methodologies. The handwritten letters are currently stored as JPEG image files, making their content impossible to search or analyze without manual transcription, which would be time-intensive and error-prone for such a large collection.

Which skill should Claire include in the indexer skillset to enable searching the contents of the handwritten letters?
