Claire, the Digital Experience Manager at MDFT Pro, is tasked with creating an intelligent virtual assistant to help students and trainers with common questions about courses, schedules, and learning resources. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, wants to provide 24/7 support across multiple communication platforms that their community already uses. Students should be able to interact with the assistant through the company website's chat widget, via email for detailed inquiries, and through Microsoft Teams where study groups and course discussions take place. The solution needs to maintain conversation context and provide consistent responses regardless of which channel users choose to communicate through.

Which Azure service should Claire use to build this multi-channel conversational AI solution?
