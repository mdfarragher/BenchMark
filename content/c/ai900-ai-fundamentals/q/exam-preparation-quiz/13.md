Mark, the Student Records Administrator at MDFT Pro, needs to digitize and process hundreds of student enrollment forms that are submitted in various paper and PDF formats. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, receives enrollment applications containing structured information like student names, contact details, course preferences, educational background, and payment information that must be accurately extracted and imported into the company's student management database. The forms follow consistent layouts but contain handwritten and typed text that needs to be automatically processed to eliminate manual data entry errors and speed up the enrollment process.

What type of AI workload should Mark use to extract structured data from these enrollment forms?
