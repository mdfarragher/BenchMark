Mark, the Facilities Risk Manager at MDFT Pro, is developing a comprehensive emergency preparedness system to protect the company's multiple training campuses and remote learning centers. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, operates educational facilities across various geographic regions that can be affected by natural disasters like floods, storms, or wildfires. Mark needs to implement an automated monitoring solution that can analyze aerial photographs and satellite imagery to quickly identify potential damage to training facilities, parking areas, and infrastructure after severe weather events. This capability will help MDFT Pro assess campus conditions remotely and prioritize emergency response efforts to ensure student and trainer safety.

What type of AI workload should Mark use to analyze aerial photographs and identify damaged facilities?
