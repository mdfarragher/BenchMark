title: "Select Features For Income Prediction Model"
type: "question"
layout: "multiple"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Education Level"
      correct: true
      explain: "Education Level shows clear correlation with income ranges in the dataset and is a meaningful predictor of earning potential in machine learning models."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Last Name"
      correct: false
      explain: "Last Name is typically not a useful feature for income prediction as surnames don't inherently correlate with earning potential and could introduce unwanted bias."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Age"
      correct: true
      explain: "Age demonstrates correlation with income in the dataset and is commonly used as a feature in income prediction models as experience often relates to earning potential."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Income Range"
      correct: false
      explain: "Income Range is the target variable (label) that the model should predict, not a feature used as input for making predictions."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "First Name"
      correct: false
      explain: "First Name has no logical relationship to income prediction and using personal names as features could introduce bias and privacy concerns."

Claire, the Student Analytics Coordinator at MDFT Pro, is developing a predictive model to help the company set appropriate pricing tiers for its professional certification courses. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, wants to understand which factors influence students' ability to invest in premium training programs so they can offer targeted financial aid and payment plans. Claire has collected data about current students and wants to build a machine learning model that can predict income ranges based on available demographic and educational information.

Based on the following student dataset, which two fields should Claire use as input features for predicting income ranges?

| First Name | Last Name | Age | Education Level | Income Range |
|------------|-----------|-----|----------------|--------------|
| Mark       | Gee       | 45  | University     | 25-50k       |
| Claire     | Harris    | 36  | High school    | 25-50k       |
| Donna      | Carreras  | 52  | University     | 50-75k       |
| Janet      | Gates     | 21  | University     | 75-100k      |
| Lucy       | Harrington| 68  | High school    | 50-75k       |

Which two fields should be used as features for the income prediction model?
