Mark, the Inventory Systems Manager at MDFT Pro, is developing an automated system to track and organize educational materials and training equipment stored in the company's resource centers. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, has multiple storage facilities where course books, technical equipment, certificates, and learning materials are arranged on shelves and need to be automatically cataloged. Mark needs to build an application that can analyze photographs of storage shelves and not only identify what educational items are present, but also determine their exact locations and coordinates within the image. This spatial information is crucial for creating automated inventory maps and guiding staff to specific item locations.

Which Azure AI service should Mark's application use to identify the coordinates of educational materials in shelf images?
