Claire, the Financial Processing Coordinator at MDFT Pro, is implementing an automated expense reporting system for the company's trainers and staff who frequently travel to deliver courses at client locations. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, needs to process thousands of receipt images each month from restaurant meals, hotel stays, transportation, and training materials purchased during business travel. Some receipts are photographed with high-resolution mobile cameras or scanned at high quality, resulting in large image files. Claire needs to understand the technical limitations of Azure AI Document Intelligence's prebuilt receipt model to ensure all receipt images can be processed successfully.

What is the maximum image file size that Azure AI Document Intelligence's prebuilt receipt model can process?
