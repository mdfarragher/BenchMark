Mark, the Voice Interface Developer at MDFT Pro, is building an intelligent voice assistant to help students navigate course catalogs and access learning resources hands-free. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, wants to provide students with a natural way to interact with their learning management system by speaking commands like "Find Azure certification courses" or "Show my progress in the data science program." The system needs to process live speech input from students and understand what they're trying to accomplish, then respond appropriately with course information, progress updates, or navigation assistance.

Which two Azure AI services does Mark need to implement this speech-based intent recognition system?
