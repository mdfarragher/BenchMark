title: "Identify Generative AI Characteristics"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Only generative AI can create new content"
      correct: false
      explain: "While generative AI does create new content like text and images, the distinction between LLMs and SLMs is also based on model parameters, making this incomplete."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Generative AI creates content and model size affects capabilities"
      correct: true
      explain: "Generative AI enables content creation like text and images, and the difference between LLMs and SLMs is indeed the number of parameters (variables) in the model."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "All statements including supervised learning classification are correct"
      correct: false
      explain: "Generative AI is not typically classified as supervised learning; it often uses unsupervised or self-supervised approaches."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "None of these characteristics apply to generative AI"
      correct: false
      explain: "Generative AI does enable content generation and model size does differentiate LLMs from SLMs through parameter count."

Claire, the Learning Technology Manager at MDFT Pro, is researching generative AI solutions to enhance the company's course creation process. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, wants to implement AI tools that can help trainers generate educational content, create practice scenarios, and develop personalized learning materials for students. 

Claire needs to understand the fundamental characteristics of generative AI technologies and how different model sizes impact their capabilities for educational content creation.

Which statements accurately describe generative AI and language model characteristics?
