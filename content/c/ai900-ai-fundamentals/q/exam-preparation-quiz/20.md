Claire, the Data Science Operations Manager at MDFT Pro, is planning the Azure Machine Learning infrastructure for the company's advanced analytics initiatives. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, needs to implement machine learning solutions for student performance prediction, course recommendation systems, and automated content personalization. The team includes both experienced data scientists who prefer coding environments and business analysts who need visual, drag-and-drop interfaces for building models. Claire must decide between basic and enterprise workspace tiers to ensure the team has access to all necessary capabilities while managing costs effectively.

Which two tasks require an enterprise workspace in Azure Machine Learning?
