Mark, the Expense Management Coordinator at MDFT Pro, is building an integrated financial system to automate expense reporting for trainers and administrative staff. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, needs to process receipt images from business meals, training materials, conference fees, and travel expenses that employees submit through various channels. Mark wants to implement a comprehensive AI solution that can extract structured data from receipts and integrate this information with the company's existing financial management applications.
