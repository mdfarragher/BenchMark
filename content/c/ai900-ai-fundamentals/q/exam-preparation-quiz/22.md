Claire, the AI Ethics Coordinator at MDFT Pro, is developing guidelines for the company's AI-powered student assessment and course recommendation systems. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, serves students from diverse backgrounds across different demographics, ethnicities, and educational experiences. Claire needs to ensure that the AI systems used for evaluating student performance, recommending courses, and providing personalized learning paths do not inadvertently favor or disadvantage students based on personal characteristics unrelated to their learning abilities or career goals. She must establish policies that promote equal treatment for all students regardless of their demographic background.
