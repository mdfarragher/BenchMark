Claire, the AI Compliance Manager at MDFT Pro, is establishing audit procedures for the company's automated student placement and course recommendation systems. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, uses AI algorithms to automatically assign students to appropriate course levels, suggest career paths, and make scholarship award decisions. Regulatory requirements and internal policies mandate that these automated decisions must be traceable and explainable, especially when they significantly impact student opportunities. Claire needs to implement systems that allow administrators, students, and auditors to understand the reasoning behind AI-driven recommendations and decisions.

Which responsible AI principle requires that automated decision-making processes be recorded so authorized users can identify why decisions were made?
