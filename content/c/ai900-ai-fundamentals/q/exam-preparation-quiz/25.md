Mark, the Business Process Automation Specialist at MDFT Pro, is evaluating Azure AI Document Intelligence to streamline various document processing tasks across the company. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, handles numerous types of documents including student enrollment forms, vendor invoices for training materials, expense receipts from business travel, course certificates, and partnership agreements.
