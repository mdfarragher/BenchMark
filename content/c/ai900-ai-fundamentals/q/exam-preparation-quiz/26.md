Claire, the Student Support Systems Developer at MDFT Pro, is building an intelligent chatbot to help students get instant answers to common questions about courses, enrollment procedures, technical issues, and learning resources. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, has extensive documentation including course troubleshooting guides stored in Word documents, frequently asked questions on their website, student handbooks in PDF format, and technical support articles. Claire needs to create a chatbot that can automatically extract information from these existing documents and provide accurate responses to student inquiries without requiring manual creation of question-answer pairs.

Which Azure service should Claire use to process the existing documents and create a knowledge base for the chatbot?
