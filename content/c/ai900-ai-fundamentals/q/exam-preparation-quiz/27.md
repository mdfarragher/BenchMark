Mark, the Equipment Safety Inspector at MDFT Pro, is developing an automated system to identify damaged training equipment and learning materials in photographs taken during routine facility inspections. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, has multiple training centers with expensive equipment like projectors, computers, laboratory instruments, and furniture that need regular safety assessments. Mark wants to use computer vision technology that can not only detect when equipment appears damaged in inspection photos, but also pinpoint exactly where the damaged items are located within each image. This location information is crucial for maintenance teams to quickly find and address safety issues.

Can object detection technology identify the specific location of damaged equipment within inspection images?
