    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Yes"
      correct: false
      explain: "Object detection identifies objects and provides bounding boxes but doesn't perform detailed shape analysis or precise boundary detection like semantic segmentation."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "No"
      correct: true
      explain: "Object detection provides rectangular bounding boxes around detected objects but cannot highlight detailed shapes or precise contours of damage like cracks."

Mark, the Maintenance Analysis Specialist at MDFT Pro, is investigating computer vision solutions to assess detailed damage patterns in training facility infrastructure and equipment. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, needs to analyze images of walls, floors, furniture, and equipment to identify not just the presence of damage, but the precise shape and extent of problems like cracks in walls, scratches on tables, or wear patterns on flooring. Mark wants to understand whether object detection technology can provide the detailed shape analysis needed to assess the specific geometry and boundaries of damage rather than just identifying that damage exists somewhere in the image.

Can object detection technology highlight the precise shape and contours of cracks or damage patterns in inspection images?
