answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Adding and connecting modules on a visual canvas"
      correct: true
      explain: "Azure Machine Learning designer provides a drag-and-drop visual interface where you connect data preparation, training, and evaluation modules to create ML pipelines."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Automatically performing data preparation tasks"
      correct: false
      explain: "While the designer includes data preparation modules, it doesn't automatically perform these tasks - you must manually configure and connect the appropriate modules."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Automatically selecting optimal algorithms"
      correct: false
      explain: "The designer requires you to manually select and configure algorithms; automatic algorithm selection is a feature of Automated ML, not the designer."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Using a code-first notebook experience"
      correct: false
      explain: "The designer is specifically a visual, low-code/no-code interface, not a code-first notebook environment like Azure ML Studio notebooks."

Mark, the Data Science Lead at MDFT Pro, is tasked with building predictive models to improve student course completion rates. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, wants to analyze student engagement patterns and learning behaviors to identify at-risk students early in their courses. Mark's team includes trainers with limited programming experience who need to participate in model development. He's evaluating Azure Machine Learning designer as a solution that allows both technical and non-technical team members to collaborate on building machine learning models.
