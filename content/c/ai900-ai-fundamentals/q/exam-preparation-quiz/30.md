Claire, the Digital Media Coordinator at MDFT Pro, is developing an intelligent photography assistant to help trainers and marketing staff take better professional photos for course materials, promotional content, and student documentation. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, needs high-quality images for course catalogs, website content, student ID photos, and instructor profiles. Claire wants to implement an AI solution that can analyze photographs in real-time and provide feedback about technical aspects like proper exposure settings, image noise levels, and whether subjects are properly visible without obstruction. This system should help staff improve their photography skills and ensure consistent image quality across all company materials.

What type of AI solution provides feedback on photographic elements like exposure, noise, and occlusion to help improve image quality?
