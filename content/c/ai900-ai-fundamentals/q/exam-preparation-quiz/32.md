Claire, the Chatbot Development Lead at MDFT Pro, is building an intelligent virtual assistant to help students navigate course catalogs, enrollment processes, and learning resources. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, wants students to interact naturally with the chatbot using phrases like "I want to learn about cloud computing" or "Help me find certification courses for beginners." Claire needs the system to understand what students are trying to accomplish - whether they're looking for specific courses, need enrollment assistance, want schedule information, or require technical support. The chatbot must accurately interpret these varied student requests to provide relevant and helpful responses.

Which Azure service should Claire use to determine student intent from natural language queries in the chatbot?
