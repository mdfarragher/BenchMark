type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Max response"
      correct: true
      explain: "Max response (or max tokens) controls the maximum length of generated responses - increasing this parameter allows the AI to generate longer, more detailed and verbose answers."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Presence penalty"
      correct: false
      explain: "Presence penalty reduces repetition by penalizing tokens that have already appeared, affecting content diversity but not response length or verbosity."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Stop sequence"
      correct: false
      explain: "Stop sequence defines specific text patterns that halt response generation, potentially making responses shorter rather than more verbose."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Temperature"
      correct: false
      explain: "Temperature controls creativity and randomness in responses but doesn't directly influence the length or verbosity of the generated content."

Claire, the Educational AI Specialist at MDFT Pro, is fine-tuning the company's AI tutoring assistant to provide more comprehensive explanations for complex technical concepts. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, offers advanced certification courses in areas like cloud computing, data science, and cybersecurity where students often need detailed, thorough explanations rather than brief responses. Claire wants the AI tutor to generate longer, more elaborate answers that include examples, step-by-step explanations, and additional context to help students fully understand challenging topics. The current responses are too concise and students are requesting more detailed guidance.

Which Azure OpenAI GPT-3.5 parameter should Claire adjust to generate longer, more detailed responses from the tutoring assistant?
