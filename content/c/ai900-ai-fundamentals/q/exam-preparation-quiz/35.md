Mark, the Document Processing Architect at MDFT Pro, is evaluating whether to use prebuilt or custom Document Intelligence models for processing the company's diverse document types. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, handles many unique forms including custom student enrollment applications, proprietary course evaluation sheets, specialized certification request forms, and partner agreement templates that don't match standard business document formats. Mark needs to understand the specific advantages of developing custom models versus relying on prebuilt solutions, particularly for handling MDFT Pro's unique document layouts and specialized educational paperwork.

What is the primary advantage of using a custom model in Azure AI Document Intelligence for MDFT Pro's document processing needs?
