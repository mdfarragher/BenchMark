type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Natural language processing (NLP)"
      correct: false
      explain: "Natural language processing works with text and language data, not numeric sensor readings or temperature monitoring from IoT devices."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Computer vision"
      correct: false
      explain: "Computer vision processes images and visual content, not time-series numeric data from temperature sensors or other IoT monitoring devices."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Knowledge mining"
      correct: false
      explain: "Knowledge mining extracts insights from unstructured content like documents and text, not real-time sensor data analysis and alerting."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Anomaly detection"
      correct: true
      explain: "Anomaly detection identifies unusual patterns or deviations from normal behavior in data streams, making it ideal for monitoring equipment conditions and triggering alerts."

Claire, the Facilities IoT Manager at MDFT Pro, has deployed smart sensors throughout the company's training centers to monitor critical equipment like HVAC systems, server room temperatures, and laboratory equipment. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, operates multiple campuses with expensive training equipment that must maintain optimal environmental conditions to function properly and ensure student safety. The IoT sensors continuously collect temperature, humidity, and power consumption data, and Claire needs an AI system that can automatically identify when readings fall outside normal operating ranges and immediately alert maintenance teams to prevent equipment failure or safety hazards.

What type of AI workload is represented by IoT devices that monitor equipment conditions and generate alerts when readings deviate from expected normal ranges?
