type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Object detection"
      correct: true
      explain: "Object detection identifies and locates multiple different objects within an image, providing bounding boxes around each detected item and classifying what each object is."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Semantic segmentation"
      correct: false
      explain: "Semantic segmentation classifies every pixel in an image but doesn't distinguish between individual instances of the same object type."

      title: "Optical character recognition (OCR)"
      correct: false
      explain: "OCR extracts text characters from images, not identifying and locating different types of physical objects or educational materials."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Image classification"
      correct: false
      explain: "Image classification assigns a single category label to an entire image but cannot identify multiple different objects within the same image."

Mark, the Digital Library Curator at MDFT Pro, is developing an automated system to catalog and organize educational resources stored in the company's digital image library. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, has thousands of photographs containing multiple different types of learning materials including textbooks, laboratory equipment, computer hardware, certificates, and training tools all arranged together in storage areas and classrooms. Mark needs a computer vision solution that can analyze these images and identify each different type of educational item present, providing both the category of each object (book, laptop, projector, etc.) and its location within the photograph for precise cataloging.

Which type of computer vision technology should Mark use to identify and locate multiple different types of educational materials within individual storage photographs?
