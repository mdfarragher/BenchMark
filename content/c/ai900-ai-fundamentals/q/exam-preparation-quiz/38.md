Claire, the AI Conversation Designer at MDFT Pro, is optimizing the company's educational chatbot to provide more varied and engaging responses to student questions. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, has noticed that their AI tutoring assistant tends to use repetitive language patterns and similar vocabulary when explaining concepts, making conversations feel monotonous and less engaging for students. Claire wants to configure the Azure OpenAI GPT-3.5 model to generate responses with a richer variety of words, phrases, and expressions while maintaining accuracy and relevance. The goal is to make the AI tutor's language more dynamic and interesting for learners.

Which Azure OpenAI parameter should Claire adjust to encourage the use of more diverse vocabulary and varied token selection in the chatbot's responses?
