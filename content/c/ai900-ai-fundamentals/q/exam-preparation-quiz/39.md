Mark, the Marketing Creative Director at MDFT Pro, is developing engaging promotional materials for the company's new course catalog and training brochures. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, wants to include custom illustrations that visually represent different certification programs, learning scenarios, and student success stories. Instead of hiring external graphic designers or purchasing stock images, Mark plans to generate unique, customized artwork using AI technology. He needs to create illustrations based on specific text descriptions like "students collaborating on a cloud computing project" or "a professional receiving their cybersecurity certification," ensuring the visuals align perfectly with MDFT Pro's educational themes.

Which Azure OpenAI model should Mark use to generate custom illustrations from text descriptions for the marketing materials?
