Claire, the Educational Technology Specialist at MDFT Pro, is developing an automated system to organize and categorize educational materials in the company's digital library. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, has thousands of training resources including textbooks, equipment photos, and course materials that need to be automatically identified and tagged. Claire needs to train a model that can detect and recognize specific educational items like laptops, projectors, whiteboards, and course certificates in submitted images from trainers across different MDFT Pro locations.

Which Azure service should Claire use to train this custom object detection model?
