title: "Define Input Data Term In Machine Learning Models"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Features"
      correct: true
      explain: "Features are the individual measurable properties or characteristics of observed phenomena that serve as input data for machine learning models to make predictions or classifications."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Activation functions"
      correct: false
      explain: "Activation functions are mathematical functions used in neural networks to determine whether a neuron should be activated, not the input data itself."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Labels"
      correct: false
      explain: "Labels are the target outputs or correct answers that models learn to predict during training, not the input data used to make those predictions."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Parameters"
      correct: false
      explain: "Parameters are the internal weights and values that the model learns during training, not the external input data fed into the model."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "Embeddings"
      correct: false
      explain: "Embeddings are dense vector representations of data created by models, not the raw input data provided to train or use the model."
    - id: "answer6"
      title: "Variables"
      correct: false
      explain: "While features can be considered variables, this term is too general and doesn't specifically refer to machine learning input data terminology."

Claire, the Data Science Training Coordinator at MDFT Pro, is developing educational materials to teach students about machine learning fundamentals and terminology. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, offers comprehensive data science certification programs where students learn to build predictive models using various types of input data such as student demographics, course performance metrics, engagement scores, and learning preferences. Claire needs to ensure students understand the correct technical terminology for the different components of machine learning systems, particularly the specific term used to describe the input data that models use to make predictions or decisions.

What is the technical term for the input data used in machine learning models to make predictions or classifications?
