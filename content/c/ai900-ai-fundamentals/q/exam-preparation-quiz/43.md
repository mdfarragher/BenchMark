title: "Select Method To Reduce Classification False Positives"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Modify the threshold value in favor of false positives"
      correct: false
      explain: "Modifying the threshold to favor false positives would actually increase false positives rather than reduce them."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Modify the threshold value in favor of false negatives"
      correct: true
      explain: "Adjusting the classification threshold to be more conservative (favoring false negatives) reduces false positives by requiring higher confidence for positive predictions."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Increase the number of training iterations"
      correct: false
      explain: "More training iterations might improve overall accuracy but doesn't specifically address the balance between false positives and false negatives."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Include test data in the training data"
      correct: false
      explain: "Including test data in training causes data leakage and overfitting, leading to unrealistic performance metrics rather than reducing false positives."

Mark, the Student Success Analytics Lead at MDFT Pro, is fine-tuning a machine learning model that predicts which students are at risk of course failure to trigger early intervention support. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, wants to minimize false positive predictions because incorrectly identifying successful students as at-risk wastes valuable counselor time and resources, while also potentially discouraging students who are actually performing well. Mark needs to adjust the model to be more conservative in its at-risk predictions, accepting that some truly at-risk students might be missed (false negatives) in order to reduce the number of false alarms (false positives) for successful students.

What should Mark do to reduce false positive predictions in the student risk assessment model?
