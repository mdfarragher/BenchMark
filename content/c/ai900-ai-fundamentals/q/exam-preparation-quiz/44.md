Claire, the Conversational AI Developer at MDFT Pro, is building an intelligent virtual assistant to help students get information about course schedules, campus weather conditions, and learning resources. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, wants students to be able to ask natural questions like "Will it rain during the outdoor team building exercise tomorrow?" or "What's the weather forecast for our field trip next week?" The system needs to understand these human language queries, interpret what information the student is requesting, and provide helpful responses by accessing relevant data sources and presenting the information in a conversational manner.

What type of AI workload is demonstrated when students ask conversational questions and receive informative text responses from a chatbot?
