Mark, the Student Feedback Analysis Coordinator at MDFT Pro, needs to process hundreds of detailed course evaluation reports that students submit each semester in free-text format. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, collects comprehensive written feedback about course content, instructor effectiveness, learning materials, and facility conditions, but manually reviewing all these reports is time-consuming. Mark wants to implement an automated system that can analyze these text-based reports to extract the most important topics, concerns, and suggestions, then generate concise summaries that highlight key themes and actionable insights for course improvement initiatives.

Which type of AI workload should Mark use to extract key terms from student feedback reports and generate summaries?
