Mark, the Machine Learning Infrastructure Manager at MDFT Pro, is setting up Azure Machine Learning capabilities for the company's data science team to build predictive models for student success and course optimization. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, wants to use automated machine learning to develop models that can predict student performance, recommend courses, and optimize training schedules. Mark needs to establish the proper Azure ML environment before the data science team can begin uploading datasets, creating experiments, and training models using automated machine learning features.

What is the first component Mark should create to enable Azure Machine Learning and automated ML development for the team?
