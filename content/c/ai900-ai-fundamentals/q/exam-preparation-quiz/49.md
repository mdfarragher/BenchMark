title: "Identify Required Data Type For K-Means Clustering Features"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Boolean"
      correct: false
      explain: "Boolean values can be used but must be converted to numeric format (0/1) since K-means requires numeric data for distance calculations."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Integer"
      correct: false
      explain: "While integers are numeric, K-means works with all numeric types including decimals, not just integers specifically."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Numeric"
      correct: true
      explain: "K-means clustering requires all features to be numeric because it calculates distances between data points using mathematical operations that only work with numbers."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Text"
      correct: false
      explain: "Text data cannot be used directly in K-means clustering and must be converted to numeric representations like word embeddings or encoded values."

Mark, the Student Segmentation Analyst at MDFT Pro, is building a K-means clustering model to group students based on their learning characteristics and course performance metrics. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, has collected diverse data about students including numerical scores (assessment grades, completion rates), categorical information (course levels, learning preferences), and text feedback (written evaluations). Before training the clustering model, Mark needs to ensure all the input features are properly formatted and compatible with the K-means algorithm's mathematical requirements for calculating distances between student profiles.

What data type requirement must all features meet when building a K-means clustering model for student segmentation?
