    - id: "answer1"
      title: "A supervised model for predicting numeric values"
      correct: false
      explain: "This describes regression, not classification. Regression predicts continuous numeric values like prices or temperatures."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "A supervised model for predicting categories"
      correct: true
      explain: "Classification is a supervised learning technique that predicts discrete categories or classes, such as pass/fail, spam/not spam, or student performance levels."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "An unsupervised model for grouping similar entities"
      correct: false
      explain: "This describes clustering, an unsupervised technique that groups similar data points without predefined categories."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "A reinforcement model for decision optimization"
      correct: false
      explain: "Reinforcement learning involves training agents through rewards and penalties, not predicting categories from labeled training data."

Mark, the Analytics Manager at MDFT Pro, is designing a machine learning system to automatically categorize student feedback and course evaluations. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, receives thousands of student comments and reviews each month that need to be sorted into different categories such as "Course Content," "Instructor Quality," "Technical Issues," and "Facility Feedback." Mark needs to understand the appropriate machine learning approach that can learn from historical labeled examples of student feedback to automatically classify new incoming reviews into these predefined categories.

What type of machine learning approach should Mark use for this categorization task?
