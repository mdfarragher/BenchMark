Claire, the Conversational Interface Designer at MDFT Pro, is developing an intelligent virtual assistant to help students schedule appointments, request callbacks from advisors, and manage their learning support needs. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, wants students to interact naturally with the system using phrases like "Call me back later," "Schedule a meeting with my advisor next week," or "I need help with my course selection." Claire needs an AI service that can understand the underlying intentions behind these varied natural language expressions and extract key information like requested actions, timeframes, and relevant entities to trigger appropriate automated responses or workflows.

Which Azure AI service should Claire use to interpret the meaning and intent behind natural language user requests like "Call me back later"?
