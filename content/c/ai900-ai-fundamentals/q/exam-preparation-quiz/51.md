Mark, the Student Support Quality Manager at MDFT Pro, is developing an automated system to analyze student support tickets and prioritize responses based on urgency and student satisfaction levels. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, receives hundreds of support requests daily from students experiencing technical issues, course access problems, and learning difficulties. Mark needs to implement a solution that can automatically assess the emotional tone and frustration level expressed in student support tickets, allowing the support team to quickly identify highly dissatisfied students who need immediate attention and personalized assistance to resolve their concerns.

What type of natural language processing workload should Mark use to understand student satisfaction levels from support ticket text?
