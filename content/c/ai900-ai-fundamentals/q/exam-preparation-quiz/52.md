Claire, the Support Ticket Analytics Coordinator at MDFT Pro, is building an automated system to organize and categorize student support requests for better response time tracking and performance analysis. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, needs to extract structured information from support tickets including submission dates, ticket categories, student contact information, and response deadlines to generate comprehensive support metrics and ensure service level agreements are met. Claire specifically needs to identify and extract temporal information like creation timestamps, response times, and resolution dates from the unstructured text content of support tickets.

What type of natural language processing workload should Claire use to extract creation dates and times from support ticket text?
