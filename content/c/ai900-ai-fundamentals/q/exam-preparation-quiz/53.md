      title: "Yes"
      correct: false
      explain: "Regression is supervised learning that requires labeled training data with known target values to learn the relationship between input features and output predictions."

      title: "No"
      correct: true
      explain: "Regression models require labeled data containing both input features and corresponding target values (labels) to learn patterns for predicting continuous numeric outcomes."

Mark, the Predictive Analytics Developer at MDFT Pro, is building a machine learning model to predict student course completion rates based on engagement metrics, assessment scores, and learning activity patterns. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, has collected extensive historical data about students including their learning behaviors and actual completion outcomes. Mark needs to train a regression model that can predict the percentage likelihood of course completion for new students, but he's unsure about the data requirements for training this type of predictive model and whether labeled examples showing actual completion rates are necessary.

Can regression models be trained using only unlabeled data without known target values?
