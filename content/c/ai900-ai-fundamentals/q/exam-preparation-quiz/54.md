      title: "Yes"
      correct: false
      explain: "Classification predicts discrete categories or classes, not sequential numerical data over time which is handled by time series forecasting or regression techniques."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "No"
      correct: true
      explain: "Classification is used to predict discrete categories or classes (like pass/fail, skill level), while time series forecasting is used for sequential numerical data over time."

Claire, the Learning Outcomes Analyst at MDFT Pro, is evaluating different machine learning approaches for various predictive analytics projects across the company's educational programs. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, needs to implement different types of models including systems that categorize students into skill levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced), predict enrollment numbers over the coming months, and forecast seasonal demand patterns for different certification programs. Claire needs to understand which machine learning techniques are appropriate for predicting categorical outcomes versus time-based sequential numerical data.

Can classification techniques be used to predict sequential numerical data that changes over time?
