Mark, the Student Behavior Research Coordinator at MDFT Pro, is analyzing patterns in student learning preferences and study habits to improve course design and personalization strategies. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, has collected comprehensive data about student engagement patterns, preferred learning modalities, study session durations, and assessment performance styles, but doesn't have predefined categories for different types of learners. Mark wants to use machine learning to automatically discover natural groupings of students with similar learning characteristics so the company can develop targeted teaching approaches and customized learning paths for each identified student segment.

Is clustering an appropriate technique for automatically grouping students based on their common learning characteristics?
