Claire, the Digital Learning Content Manager at MDFT Pro, is developing an accessibility initiative to make the company's educational content more inclusive for students with different learning needs. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, has extensive libraries of recorded lectures, webinar sessions, and training presentations that need to be converted into text format to support students with hearing impairments and those who prefer reading over listening. Claire needs to implement an automated solution that can process audio files from various educational sessions and generate accurate written transcripts that can be searched, edited, and integrated with the company's learning management system.

What type of AI workload is involved in converting voice recordings into written text transcripts?
