Mark, the Digital Asset Manager at MDFT Pro, needs to organize and categorize thousands of educational photographs in the company's digital library including classroom scenes, training equipment, campus facilities, student activities, and course materials. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, has accumulated extensive visual content over the years that lacks proper metadata and descriptive tags, making it difficult for trainers and marketing staff to locate specific images when creating course materials and promotional content. Mark wants to implement an automated solution that can analyze these photographs and generate descriptive labels and tags without requiring manual custom model training.

Which Azure AI service should Mark use to automatically generate descriptive labels for the educational photograph collection?
