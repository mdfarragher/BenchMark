answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Classification"
      correct: false
      explain: "Classification predicts discrete categories or classes, not continuous numeric values like enrollment numbers or population sizes."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Regression"
      correct: true
      explain: "Regression is designed to predict continuous numeric values, making it appropriate for forecasting quantities like student enrollment numbers or capacity planning."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Clustering"
      correct: false
      explain: "Clustering groups similar items together but doesn't predict numeric values or quantities for planning and forecasting purposes."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Time series forecasting"
      correct: false
      explain: "Time series forecasting predicts values over time using historical patterns, which isn't necessary for single-point enrollment predictions based on program characteristics."

Claire, the Enrollment Forecasting Analyst at MDFT Pro, is developing predictive models to help the company plan course capacity and resource allocation for upcoming training programs. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, needs to predict student enrollment numbers for new certification courses based on factors like course difficulty, market demand, pricing, instructor reputation, and seasonal trends. Claire wants to build a machine learning model that can forecast the expected number of students who will enroll in each course offering, enabling the company to optimize classroom sizes, instructor assignments, and learning material quantities before course launches.

Which type of machine learning should Claire use to predict the numeric quantity of student enrollments for course planning?
