    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Yes"
      correct: false
      explain: "Object detection models in Custom Vision don't require choosing between Multilabel or Multiclass - these options apply to image classification models, not object detection."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "No"
      correct: true
      explain: "Object detection models have different configuration options focused on detecting and locating objects within images, not classifying entire images into categories."

Mark, the Computer Vision Solutions Architect at MDFT Pro, is developing an automated system to identify and locate educational equipment in classroom photographs for inventory management purposes. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, needs to track laptops, projectors, whiteboards, and other training materials across multiple campus locations. Mark is configuring Azure Custom Vision to build an object detection model that can find and mark the locations of different equipment types within photographs. He's comparing the setup requirements for object detection models versus image classification models to ensure he's using the correct configuration options for detecting multiple equipment items within single images.

When creating an object detection model in Custom Vision, must you choose between Multilabel or Multiclass classification types like you do for image classification models?
