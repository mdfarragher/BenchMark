Mark, the Content Processing Specialist at MDFT Pro, needs to implement an automated system to create executive summaries of lengthy educational research papers, policy documents, and industry reports for the company's leadership team. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, regularly receives extensive documents about educational trends, certification requirements, and market analysis that need to be condensed into brief, actionable summaries for strategic planning meetings.
