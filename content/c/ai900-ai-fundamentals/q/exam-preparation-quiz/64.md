title: "Identify Prompt Engineering Technique For Context Enhancement"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Providing examples"
      correct: false
      explain: "Providing examples (few-shot learning) gives the model sample inputs and outputs to learn patterns, but doesn't provide broader contextual information."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Fine-tuning"
      correct: false
      explain: "Fine-tuning involves retraining a model on specific data, which is a model modification technique rather than a prompt engineering approach."

      title: "System messages"
      correct: false
      explain: "System messages set the AI's role and behavior instructions but don't provide specific contextual information to improve response accuracy."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Grounding data"
      correct: true
      explain: "Grounding data provides relevant contextual information and facts that help the AI generate more accurate, informed responses based on specific knowledge."

Claire, the AI Prompt Engineering Specialist at MDFT Pro, is optimizing the company's generative AI tutoring system to provide more accurate and relevant responses to student questions about specific certification programs. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, wants the AI tutor to reference current course materials, updated certification requirements, and company-specific learning resources when answering student questions. Claire is implementing techniques to supply the AI system with relevant background information and current course data to ensure responses are aligned with MDFT Pro's curriculum and contain up-to-date, factually correct information rather than generic or outdated content.

What prompt engineering technique involves providing contextual information to improve the accuracy and relevance of generative AI responses?
