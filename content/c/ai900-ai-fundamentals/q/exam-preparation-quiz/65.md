title: "Identify Required Label Data Type For Regression Models"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Boolean"
      correct: false
      explain: "Boolean values (true/false) are used for binary classification problems, not regression which predicts continuous numeric values."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Datetime"
      correct: false
      explain: "Datetime values represent time-based data, which would need to be converted to numeric format for regression analysis of temporal patterns."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Numeric"
      correct: true
      explain: "Regression models predict continuous numeric values, so the target labels must be numeric data types like integers, decimals, or floating-point numbers."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Text"
      correct: false
      explain: "Text data is categorical and used for classification problems, not regression which requires numeric target values for prediction."

Mark, the Student Performance Analytics Lead at MDFT Pro, is developing a regression model to predict student course completion scores based on engagement metrics, assignment grades, and participation levels. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, wants to forecast the numerical percentage scores that students will achieve on their final assessments to identify those who may need additional support before course completion. Mark is preparing the training data and needs to ensure that the target variable (the completion scores) is formatted correctly for the regression algorithm to learn patterns and make accurate numeric predictions.

What data type must the target labels have when building a regression model to predict student completion scores?
