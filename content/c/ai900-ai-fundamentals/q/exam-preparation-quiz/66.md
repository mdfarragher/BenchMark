Claire, the Machine Learning Training Coordinator at MDFT Pro, is developing educational workshops to teach business analysts and trainers how to build predictive models without extensive programming knowledge. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, wants to empower non-technical staff to create machine learning solutions for student analytics and course optimization. Claire is evaluating Azure Machine Learning Studio's capabilities to determine if it provides user-friendly visual tools that allow workshop participants to build ML pipelines through drag-and-drop interfaces rather than requiring them to write Python or R code.

Does Azure Machine Learning Studio provide visual tools for connecting datasets and modules on an interactive design canvas?
