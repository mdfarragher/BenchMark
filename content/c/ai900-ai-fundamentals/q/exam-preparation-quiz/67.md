Mark, the Business Intelligence Democratization Manager at MDFT Pro, is planning to enable business analysts and course coordinators to build their own predictive models for student enrollment forecasting and course performance analysis. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, has many domain experts who understand educational data and business requirements but lack programming skills in Python, R, or other data science languages. Mark needs to evaluate whether automated machine learning solutions can enable these business users to create effective ML models through intuitive interfaces without requiring them to learn coding or hire additional data scientists.

Can automated machine learning enable business users to implement ML solutions without programming experience?
