Claire, the Advanced Analytics Pipeline Developer at MDFT Pro, is building sophisticated machine learning workflows that require custom data preprocessing logic, proprietary algorithms, and specialized post-processing for educational analytics. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, has unique requirements for analyzing student learning patterns that go beyond standard ML operations, including custom feature engineering for educational metrics and specialized validation techniques for course effectiveness models. Claire needs to integrate custom Python code that implements MDFT Pro's proprietary analytical methods within the broader ML pipeline infrastructure.

Does Azure Machine Learning service support including custom Python scripts within training pipelines for specialized processing requirements?
