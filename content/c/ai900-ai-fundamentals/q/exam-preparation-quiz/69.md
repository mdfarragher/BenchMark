Mark, the Educational Content Organizer at MDFT Pro, is developing an automated system to sort and categorize thousands of educational photographs and teaching materials stored in the company's digital library. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, has extensive collections of wildlife biology course materials, including photographs of different animal species used in environmental science and biology certification programs. Mark needs to automatically separate images of arctic wildlife from temperate forest animals to organize course materials by geographic region and climate zone, enabling trainers to quickly find relevant visual content for their specific lesson plans and student assignments.

What type of computer vision task should Mark use to automatically separate and categorize different types of animal photographs for educational content organization?
