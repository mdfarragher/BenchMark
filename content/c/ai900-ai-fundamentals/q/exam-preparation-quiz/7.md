Mark, the Customer Experience Manager at MDFT Pro, is tasked with improving student satisfaction by analyzing feedback from course evaluations and online reviews. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, receives hundreds of written reviews each week from students describing their learning experiences, instructor effectiveness, and overall satisfaction with courses. Mark needs to implement an automated system that can quickly process these text-based reviews and determine whether each review expresses positive feelings (satisfied students), negative feelings (dissatisfied students), or neutral opinions about the training programs.
