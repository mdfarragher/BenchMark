type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Face detection"
      correct: false
      explain: "Face detection locates human faces in images, not educational specimens or teaching materials used in biology and environmental science courses."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Face recognition"
      correct: false
      explain: "Face recognition identifies specific individuals, not locating educational subjects or objects within instructional photographs."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Image classification"
      correct: false
      explain: "Image classification categorizes entire images but doesn't provide location coordinates or bounding boxes for specific subjects within the image."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Object detection"
      correct: true
      explain: "Object detection identifies objects in images and provides their precise locations through bounding boxes, ideal for locating educational subjects or specimens."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "Optical character recognition"
      correct: false
      explain: "OCR extracts text from images but doesn't identify or locate visual objects or educational subjects within photographs."
    - id: "answer6"
      title: "Semantic segmentation"
      correct: false
      explain: "Semantic segmentation identifies pixel-level boundaries but is more detailed than needed for simply locating objects with bounding boxes."

Claire, the Interactive Learning Content Developer at MDFT Pro, is creating an engaging educational application where students can click on wildlife subjects in photographs to access detailed information about animal behavior and habitat. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, offers environmental science courses that use interactive digital materials to enhance student engagement and learning outcomes. Claire needs to implement a computer vision system that can automatically identify where educational subjects are positioned within photographs and create clickable areas that trigger informational popups when students interact with specific animals or objects in the learning materials.

What type of computer vision task should Claire use to determine the precise location and boundaries of educational subjects within instructional photographs?
