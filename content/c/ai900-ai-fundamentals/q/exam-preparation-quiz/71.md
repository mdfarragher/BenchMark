type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Face detection"
      correct: false
      explain: "Face detection identifies human faces with rectangular boundaries, not pixel-level analysis of educational subjects or specimens."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Face recognition"
      correct: false
      explain: "Face recognition matches specific individuals but doesn't perform detailed pixel-level analysis of objects or educational materials."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Image classification"
      correct: false
      explain: "Image classification assigns labels to entire images but doesn't identify individual pixels or precise boundaries within the image."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Object detection"
      correct: false
      explain: "Object detection provides rectangular bounding boxes around objects but doesn't identify the exact pixel-level shape or boundaries."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "Optical character recognition"
      correct: false
      explain: "OCR focuses on text extraction from images, not pixel-level analysis of visual objects or educational specimens."
    - id: "answer6"
      title: "Semantic segmentation"
      correct: true
      explain: "Semantic segmentation classifies every pixel in an image, identifying exactly which pixels belong to specific objects or subjects, providing precise boundaries."

Mark, the Advanced Visual Analytics Specialist at MDFT Pro, is developing sophisticated image analysis tools for the company's veterinary and biology training programs. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, offers specialized courses in wildlife biology and veterinary science where students need to precisely identify anatomical features, measure body parts, and analyze the exact shape and size of animal subjects in photographs. Mark needs to implement a computer vision system that can provide pixel-perfect accuracy in identifying which parts of an image contain specific educational subjects, enabling students to perform detailed morphological studies and accurate measurements for their research projects.

What type of computer vision task should Mark use to identify the exact pixels that belong to educational subjects for precise analysis and measurement?
