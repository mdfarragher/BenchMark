title: "Select Appropriate Classification Model Evaluation Metric"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "True positive rate"
      correct: true
      explain: "True positive rate (sensitivity/recall) measures the proportion of actual positives correctly identified, making it a key metric for evaluating classification model performance."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Mean absolute error (MAE)"
      correct: false
      explain: "MAE measures average prediction errors for continuous values, making it appropriate for regression models, not classification models."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Coefficient of determination (R2)"
      correct: false
      explain: "R2 measures how well a regression model explains variance in continuous target variables, not classification accuracy for discrete categories."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Root mean squared error (RMSE)"
      correct: false
      explain: "RMSE measures prediction accuracy for continuous numeric values in regression models, not classification performance for categorical predictions."
