Claire, the Marketing Analytics Coordinator at MDFT Pro, is developing a competitive analysis system to monitor brand visibility in educational content and training materials. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, wants to automatically scan through thousands of photos from industry conferences, training sessions, and educational events to identify mentions and appearances of major technology brands like Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Adobe. Claire needs a solution that can immediately recognize these established brands without requiring extensive setup or custom training, as the company needs to quickly analyze existing photo archives from past events.

Which Azure AI service should Claire use for this pre-built brand recognition capability?
