Mark, the Content Analysis Specialist at MDFT Pro, is building an automated system to process and categorize information from educational articles and research papers. MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, receives dozens of industry publications each week that need to be analyzed for relevant content about training methodologies, educational technologies, and industry trends. The system needs to automatically identify and categorize specific types of information within these articles, such as names of educational institutions, technology companies, people mentioned, dates of events, and numerical statistics.

Based on the following example output showing categorized entities like "Microsoft [Organization]" and "students [PersonType]", which natural language processing operation was performed?

| Input Text | Output |
|------------|---------|
| "For weeks now, students and teachers have been settling into distance learning..." | now [DateTime]<br>students [PersonType]<br>teachers [PersonType]<br>distance learning [Skill]<br>Microsoft [Organization]<br>175 [Quantity-Number] |

What type of text processing operation produces this categorized output?
