"For weeks now, students and teachers
have been settling into the uncharted
routine of distance learning. Today I
want to thank all of the educators who
are connecting classrooms and
classmates together in the sudden shift
to remote learning. This change requires
everyone working together and is unlike
anything we've seen in the modern
history of education. We've seen
countries, school districts and
universities move rapidly into remote
learning environments with Microsoft
Teams being used in 175 countries by
183,000 institutions."
