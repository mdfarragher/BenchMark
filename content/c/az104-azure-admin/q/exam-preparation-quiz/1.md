title: "Azure Alert Processing Rules During Maintenance Windows"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Yes"
      correct: true
      explain: "Alert1 will be listed in the Azure portal because even though an alert processing rule is configured to suppress notifications during the maintenance window (August 10-13, 2025), the alert rule itself remains active and continues to detect administrative operations. The alert processing rule only suppresses notifications and actions, but the alerts are still generated and visible in the portal."

      title: "No"
      correct: false
      explain: "This is incorrect because alert processing rules suppress notifications and actions but do not prevent alerts from being generated or appearing in the Azure portal. The alert will still be created and visible, just without any notifications being sent."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, operates an Azure subscription called Students-Sub that contains various educational resources. As a newly hired Azure administrator for MDFT Pro, you are responsible for managing the monitoring and alerting infrastructure. Mark, the the Cloud Infrastructure Lead, has configured a comprehensive alerting system to track administrative changes across all training resources. The subscription contains the following resources:

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Training-RG | Resource group containing student course materials |
| Notify-Trainers | Action group that sends email notifications to mark@mdftpro.com |

The Students-Sub subscription has been configured with the following alert rule:
- **Name**: AdminAlert
- **Scope**: All resource groups in Students-Sub (including future resources)
- **Condition**: All administrative operations
- **Actions**: Notify-Trainers

Additionally, there is an alert processing rule configured for planned maintenance:
- **Name**: MaintenanceWindow
- **Scope**: Students-Sub
- **Rule type**: Suppress notifications
- **Schedule**: August 10, 2025 to August 13, 2025

If you create a new resource group called "Course-Materials" in the Students-Sub subscription on August 11, 2025, will the AdminAlert be visible in the Azure portal?
