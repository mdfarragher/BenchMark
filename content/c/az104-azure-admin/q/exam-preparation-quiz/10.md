      title: "Yes"
      correct: false
      explain: "This is incorrect because adding a triggered WebJob does not address the fundamental limitation of the Free pricing tier. WebJobs in the Free tier are also subject to the same timeout restrictions and lack the Always On feature required for continuous operation."

      title: "No"
      correct: true
      explain: "Adding a triggered WebJob does not solve the problem because it does not address the core limitation of the Free pricing tier. The Free tier lacks the Always On feature and has timeout restrictions that cause apps to stop after periods of inactivity. To run continuously for 24 hours, the app needs to be upgraded to Basic, Standard, or Premium pricing tiers which include the Always On feature."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, operates an Azure web app called LearningHub that provides continuous online course access to students around the world. As the newly hired Azure administrator for MDFT Pro, you have discovered a critical issue affecting the learning platform's availability. The LearningHub app is currently running on an App Service plan called StudentPlan that uses the Free pricing tier to minimize costs. 

Mark, the CTO and boss at MDFT Pro, has been receiving complaints from international students because the app stops functioning after running continuously for 60 minutes, causing disruption to their study sessions and online exams.

The Free tier limitation is preventing MDFT Pro from delivering reliable 24/7 educational services to their global student base. You need to determine whether adding a triggered WebJob to the LearningHub app will resolve the continuous operation requirement and allow students to access their courses without interruption throughout the day.

Does adding a triggered WebJob to the LearningHub app meet the goal of ensuring continuous 24-hour operation?
