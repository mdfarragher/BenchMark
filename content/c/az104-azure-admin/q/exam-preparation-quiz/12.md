### Question 12

You have an Azure subscription that contains a storage account named storage1. The storage1 account contains a container named container1.  
You create a blob lifecycle rule named rule1.  
You need to configure rule1 to automatically move blobs that were NOT updated for 45 days from contained to the Cool access tier.  

How should you complete the rule? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.  
NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "enabled": true,
      "name": "rule1",
      "type": "Lifecycle",
      "definition": {
        "filters": {
          "blobTypes": [ "__________" ],
          "prefixMatch": [ "container1/" ] 
        },
        "actions": {
          "baseBlob": {
            "tierToCool": { "__________": 45 }
          }
	    }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
