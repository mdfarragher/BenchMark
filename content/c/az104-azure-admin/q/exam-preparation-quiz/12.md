answers:
  - id: "answer1"
    title: "AppendBlob"
    correct: false
    explain: "AppendBlob is optimized for append operations and is commonly used for log files. While it can be included in lifecycle rules, BlockBlob is the most common type for general storage scenarios and automatic tiering."
  - id: "answer2"
    title: "BlockBlob"
    correct: true
    explain: "BlockBlob is the most common blob type used for storing text and binary data. It supports all access tiers (Hot, Cool, Archive) and is the standard choice for lifecycle management rules that tier blobs based on age."
  - id: "answer3"
    title: "PageBlob"
    correct: false
    explain: "PageBlob is optimized for random read/write operations and is primarily used for Virtual Hard Disks (VHDs). It does not support the Cool or Archive access tiers, making it unsuitable for this lifecycle rule."
  - id: "answer4"
    title: "All blob types"
    correct: false
    explain: "While you can specify multiple blob types, not all types support all access tiers. PageBlobs don't support Cool or Archive tiers, so specifying all types would cause the rule to fail for PageBlobs."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, uses Azure Storage to manage their extensive collection of training videos and course materials. Claire, the Storage Administrator at MDFT Pro, has been tasked with optimizing storage costs for their content library. The company stores thousands of training videos in a storage account named storage1, within a container called container1. To reduce costs, Claire needs to create a lifecycle rule named rule1 that automatically moves blobs to the Cool access tier if they haven't been updated for 45 days, as older course materials are accessed less frequently by students.

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "enabled": true,
      "name": "rule1",
      "type": "Lifecycle",
      "definition": {
        "filters": {
          "blobTypes": [ "__________" ],
          "prefixMatch": [ "container1/" ] 
        },
        "actions": {
          "baseBlob": {
            "tierToCool": { "daysAfterModificationGreaterThan": 45 }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Which blob type should Claire specify in the "blobTypes" array for this lifecycle rule?
