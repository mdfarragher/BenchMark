title: "Configure Blob Lifecycle Rule Trigger Condition"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
  - id: "answer1"
    title: "daysAfterCreationGreaterThan"
    correct: false
    explain: "This property triggers actions based on when the blob was created, not when it was last updated. Since the requirement is to move blobs that haven't been updated for 45 days, creation date is not the appropriate trigger."
  - id: "answer2"
    title: "daysAfterLastAccessTimeGreaterThan"
    correct: false
    explain: "This property requires last access time tracking to be enabled on the storage account. It tracks when a blob was last read, but the question specifically asks about blobs that were not updated (modified) for 45 days."
  - id: "answer3"
    title: "daysAfterModificationGreaterThan"
    correct: true
    explain: "This property is the correct choice as it tracks when a blob was last modified or updated. It aligns perfectly with the requirement to move blobs that have not been updated for 45 days to the Cool access tier."
  - id: "answer4"
    title: "daysAfterArchiveAccessTimeGreaterThan"
    correct: false
    explain: "This is not a valid property for lifecycle management rules. Archive access time properties are not used in this context for moving blobs to Cool tier."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, needs to optimize storage costs for their digital course library stored in Azure. As the newly hired cloud solutions architect for MDFT Pro, you are configuring a blob lifecycle management rule for their storage account named storage1 under direction from Mark, the CTO and boss at MDFT Pro. 

The company's training materials are stored in container1, and they want to automatically move course content that hasn't been updated for 45 days to the Cool access tier to reduce storage costs while maintaining accessibility for students and trainers.

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "enabled": true,
      "name": "rule1",
      "type": "Lifecycle",
      "definition": {
        "filters": {
          "blobTypes": [ "blockBlob" ],
          "prefixMatch": [ "container1/" ] 
        },
        "actions": {
          "baseBlob": {
            "tierToCool": { "__________": 45 }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Which property should you specify in the "tierToCool" configuration to trigger the rule for blobs that haven't been updated for 45 days?
