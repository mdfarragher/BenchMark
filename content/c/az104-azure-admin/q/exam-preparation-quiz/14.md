title: "Configure Route Table Address Prefix For VPN Traffic"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
  - id: "answer1"
    title: "10.0.0.0/16"
    correct: true
    explain: "This address prefix covers the entire VNet1 address space, ensuring that all inbound traffic from the VPN gateway destined for any subnet in VNet1 will be routed through the virtual appliance VM1."
  - id: "answer2"
    title: "10.0.1.0/24"
    correct: false
    explain: "This prefix only covers Subnet1 where VM1 is located. It would not route traffic destined for Subnet0 or Subnet2 through the virtual appliance, missing traffic intended for those subnets."
  - id: "answer3"
    title: "10.0.254.0/24"
    correct: false
    explain: "This prefix only covers the GatewaySubnet. Since this is where VPN traffic originates from, not where it's destined, this would not achieve the desired routing behavior."
  - id: "answer4"
    title: "0.0.0.0/0"
    correct: false
    explain: "This would route all traffic through VM1, including internet-bound traffic. This is overly broad and could negatively impact performance and functionality for traffic not intended for VNet1."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, has deployed a hub-and-spoke network architecture in Azure to support their distributed learning infrastructure. As the newly hired network administrator for MDFT Pro, you need to ensure that all VPN traffic from remote training centers is properly filtered and monitored for security compliance under direction from Mark, the Cloud Solutions Architect. 

The company has deployed a virtual network named VNet1 with the address space 10.0.0.0/16, containing multiple subnets for different educational services.

| Subnet Name | IP Address Range |
|-------------|------------------|
| Subnet0 | 10.0.0.0/24 |
| Subnet1 | 10.0.1.0/24 |
| Subnet2 | 10.0.2.0/24 |
| GatewaySubnet | 10.0.254.0/24 |

Subnet1 contains a virtual appliance named VM1 that operates as a security router to inspect and filter all incoming traffic. You have created a routing table named RT1 and need to configure it to route all inbound traffic from the VPN gateway through VM1 for security inspection before reaching any resources in VNet1.

What address prefix should you configure in RT1 to achieve this routing requirement?
