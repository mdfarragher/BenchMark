title: "Assign Route Table To Appropriate Subnet For VPN Traffic"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
  - id: "answer1"
    title: "GatewaySubnet"
    correct: true
    explain: "The GatewaySubnet is where the VPN gateway resides and where inbound VPN traffic first enters the virtual network. Associating the route table with GatewaySubnet ensures that all traffic coming from the VPN gateway is immediately routed through VM1."
  - id: "answer2"
    title: "Subnet0"
    correct: false
    explain: "Associating the route table with Subnet0 would only affect traffic originating from or destined to Subnet0. It would not capture inbound VPN traffic that needs to be routed through VM1 before reaching any subnet."
  - id: "answer3"
    title: "Subnet1 and Subnet2"
    correct: false
    explain: "Associating the route table with Subnet1 and Subnet2 would affect outbound traffic from these subnets, but would not capture inbound VPN traffic. The goal is to route inbound VPN traffic, which must be controlled at the GatewaySubnet level."
  - id: "answer4"
    title: "All subnets"
    correct: false
    explain: "While this would work, it's overly broad and could create routing loops or unintended traffic patterns. The specific requirement is to route inbound VPN traffic, which only requires association with the GatewaySubnet."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, is finalizing the configuration of their secure network routing for VPN connectivity. As the newly hired network operations manager for MDFT Pro, you have successfully created routing table RT1 with the address prefix 10.0.0.0/16 and configured it to use "Virtual appliance" as the next hop type to route traffic through their security appliance VM1 under direction from Mark, the Systems Integration Manager. 

Now you need to determine which subnet should be associated with RT1 to ensure all inbound VPN traffic from remote training centers is properly routed through VM1 for security inspection.

| Subnet Name | IP Address Range | Purpose |
|-------------|------------------|---------|
| Subnet0 | 10.0.0.0/24 | Student Portal Servers |
| Subnet1 | 10.0.1.0/24 | Security Appliance (VM1) |
| Subnet2 | 10.0.2.0/24 | Training Management Systems |
| GatewaySubnet | 10.0.254.0/24 | VPN Gateway |

The company needs to ensure that all VPN traffic entering the virtual network is immediately directed through VM1 for inspection before reaching any of the application subnets containing their educational platforms and student data.

To which subnet should you assign route table RT1 to achieve the required traffic flow?
