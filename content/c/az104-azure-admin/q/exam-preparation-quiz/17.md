title: "Move Virtual Machine To Different Host For Maintenance"

answers:
  - id: "answer1"
    title: "Yes"
    correct: false
    explain: "Moving VM1 to another subscription does not move it to a different host. This is a logical organizational change within Azure that doesn't address the underlying host maintenance issue affecting the VM."
  - id: "answer2"
    title: "No"
    correct: true
    explain: "Moving a VM to another subscription does not change the physical host where the VM is running. To move VM1 to a different host immediately, you would need to redeploy the VM or stop and start it to trigger a host change."
  - id: "answer3"
    title: "Only if done during maintenance window"
    correct: false
    explain: "The timing of moving a VM to another subscription does not affect whether this action will move it to a different physical host. Subscription moves are administrative changes that don't involve host migration."
  - id: "answer4"
    title: "Only if the target subscription is in a different region"
    correct: false
    explain: "Moving to a different subscription, even in another region, doesn't automatically trigger a host change for the VM. The VM would need to be redeployed or recreated in the target region to achieve host migration."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, operates critical learning management systems on Azure virtual machines that support thousands of students worldwide. As the newly hired infrastructure manager for MDFT Pro, you have received a notification that VM1, which hosts their primary student assessment platform, will be affected by planned Azure host maintenance. 

The maintenance could cause downtime during peak exam periods, so Mark, the CTO and boss at MDFT Pro, needs you to immediately move VM1 to a different host to avoid disruption to student examinations. The VM was originally deployed using a custom ARM template named ARM1.json for their specific educational software configuration.

Your team has proposed moving VM1 to another subscription as a solution to relocate it to a different host immediately.

Does this approach meet the goal of moving VM1 to a different host?
