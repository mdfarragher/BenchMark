MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, manages an extensive digital library of training materials, including thousands of course images, diagrams, and visual aids stored in their Azure Storage account named storage1. As the newly hired data management specialist for MDFT Pro, you need to implement a disaster recovery solution for their critical educational content under direction from Mark, the CTO and boss at MDFT Pro. 

The company wants to use Azure's object replication feature to automatically replicate all training images from storage1 to a new storage account in a different region, ensuring business continuity and protecting against regional outages that could disrupt their online learning platform.
