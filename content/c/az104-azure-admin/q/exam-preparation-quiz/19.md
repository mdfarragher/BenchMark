title: "Configure Object Type For Storage Account Replication"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
  - id: "answer1"
    title: "Container"
    correct: true
    explain: "Containers are the correct object type to create in the destination storage account for object replication. Blob containers serve as the logical grouping mechanism for blobs and are required to store replicated image files."
  - id: "answer2"
    title: "File share"
    correct: false
    explain: "File shares are used for Azure Files service, not for blob storage. Since the images are stored as blobs in storage1, the destination account needs containers, not file shares, to receive the replicated blob data."
  - id: "answer3"
    title: "Table"
    correct: false
    explain: "Tables are used for Azure Table storage, which stores structured NoSQL data. This is not appropriate for replicating image files that are stored as blobs in the source storage account."
  - id: "answer4"
    title: "Queue"
    correct: false
    explain: "Queues are used for Azure Queue storage to handle message queuing between application components. This is not the appropriate object type for storing replicated image files."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, is setting up object replication for their educational image library to ensure high availability across regions. As the newly hired storage administrator for MDFT Pro, you have successfully created a new StorageV2 account in a secondary region to serve as the destination for object replication under direction from Mark, the CTO and boss at MDFT Pro. 

Now you need to configure the appropriate storage objects in the new account to receive the replicated training images, course diagrams, and educational graphics from their primary storage account named storage1. The images are currently stored as blobs in various containers organized by course categories and training modules.

You need to determine what type of storage object should be created in the destination storage account to properly receive and organize the replicated image files.

What object type should you create in the new storage account to support object replication of the images?
