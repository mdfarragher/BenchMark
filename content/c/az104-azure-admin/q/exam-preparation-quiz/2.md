      title: "Yes"
      correct: false
      explain: "This is incorrect because alert processing rules that suppress notifications prevent action groups from sending notifications during the specified time window. Even though the alert is generated and visible in the portal, no email notifications will be sent to the configured recipients during the suppression period."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "No"
      correct: true
      explain: "Alert processing rules configured with 'Suppress notifications' prevent action groups from sending any notifications during the specified time window. The alert itself is still generated and visible in the Azure portal, but all notification actions (including email) are suppressed until the rule expires."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, operates an Azure subscription called Students-Sub that contains various educational resources. As a newly hired Azure administrator for MDFT Pro, you are responsible for managing the monitoring and alerting infrastructure. Mark, the boss at MDFT Pro, has configured a comprehensive alerting system to track administrative changes across all training resources, but has also implemented maintenance windows to reduce alert noise. The subscription contains the following resources:

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Training-RG | Resource group containing student course materials |
| Notify-Trainers | Action group that sends email notifications to mark@mdftpro.com |

The Students-Sub subscription has been configured with the following alert rule:
- **Name**: AdminAlert
- **Scope**: All resource groups in Students-Sub (including future resources)
- **Condition**: All administrative operations
- **Actions**: Notify-Trainers

Additionally, there is an alert processing rule configured for planned maintenance:
- **Name**: MaintenanceWindow
- **Scope**: Students-Sub
- **Rule type**: Suppress notifications
- **Schedule**: August 10, 2025 to August 13, 2025

If you create a new resource group called "Course-Materials" in the Students-Sub subscription on August 12, 2025, will an email notification be sent to mark@mdftpro.com?
