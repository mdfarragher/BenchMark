title: "Multi-Factor Authentication Provider Configuration Change"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
  - id: "answer1"
    title: "Yes"
    correct: false
    explain: "Creating a new MFA provider does not meet the goal. You cannot simply change the usage model from Per Authentication to Per Enabled User by creating a new provider, and there is no backup/restore functionality for MFA provider data."
  - id: "answer2"
    title: "No"
    correct: true
    explain: "The solution does not meet the goal. Azure MFA providers are legacy and deprecated. Modern Azure AD supports changing MFA settings through Azure AD conditional access policies and per-user MFA settings without creating new providers."
  - id: "answer3"
    title: "Only if the provider is in the same tenant"
    correct: false
    explain: "MFA provider creation is not the correct approach regardless of tenant location. The usage model change should be handled through Azure AD MFA settings, not by creating new providers."
  - id: "answer4"
    title: "Only with administrative approval"
    correct: false
    explain: "Administrative approval doesn't change the fact that creating a new MFA provider is not the correct solution. The usage model should be configured through proper Azure AD MFA settings."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, has been using Azure Multi-Factor Authentication to secure access for their remote trainers and support staff when working from locations outside their main office. The company initially configured their MFA setup with the Per Authentication usage model, which charges based on the number of authentication requests. 

After acquiring a smaller educational company and integrating their employees into Azure Active Directory, you as the newly hired identity security manager for MDFT Pro, have been informed by Mark, the Cloud Engineering Manager, that the new staff members should also use Multi-Factor Authentication. However, due to the larger number of users, the company wants to switch to the Per Enabled User model, which charges based on the number of users enabled for MFA rather than per authentication attempt.

The IT team has proposed creating a new Multi-Factor Authentication provider with a backup from the existing MFA provider data to achieve this change in usage model.

Does this solution meet the goal of changing from Per Authentication to Per Enabled User usage model?
