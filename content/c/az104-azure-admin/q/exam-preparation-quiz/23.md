    title: "Yes"
    correct: true
    explain: "You can manually create additional resource groups like RG3 outside of the ARM template deployment. The template only creates RG0, RG1, and RG2, but does not prevent manual creation of other resource groups in the subscription."
  - id: "answer2"
    title: "No"
    correct: false
    explain: "There is no restriction preventing manual creation of additional resource groups. The ARM template deployment only affects the resources it defines and does not impose limitations on creating other resources manually."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, has standardized their Azure infrastructure deployment using ARM templates for consistent resource group creation across their educational environments. As the newly hired cloud operations manager for MDFT Pro, you have deployed an ARM template that automatically creates three resource groups (RG0, RG1, RG2) with appropriate security controls for different purposes under direction from Mark, the CTO and boss at MDFT Pro:

- RG0 for development
- RG1 for staging with CanNotDelete protection
- RG2 for production with ReadOnly protection

As their training programs expand, the company needs additional resource groups for specialized training environments, pilot programs, and temporary educational events that require isolated infrastructure. The development team wants to know if they can create additional resource groups beyond those defined in the ARM template.

After deploying this template using `New-AzDeployment -Location westus -TemplateFile "deploy.json"`, can you manually create a resource group named RG3?
