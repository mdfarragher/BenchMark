    title: "VM1 and VM1Managed only"
    correct: false
    explain: "This severely limits the moveable resources. Storage accounts, virtual networks, and Recovery Services vaults can also be moved between subscriptions with proper planning and dependency resolution."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, has been operating their educational infrastructure on Azure subscription AZPT1, which contains various resources supporting their online learning platforms and virtual classroom environments. Due to organizational restructuring and the need to separate billing for different business units, you as the newly hired cloud architecture manager for MDFT Pro, need to move resources to a newly created subscription named AZPT2 under direction from Mark, the CTO and boss at MDFT Pro. 

The existing subscription contains critical educational infrastructure including virtual machines hosting their learning management system, storage accounts containing student course materials, networking components for secure connectivity, and backup solutions protecting their valuable educational content.

| Resource Name | Resource Type | Purpose |
|---------------|---------------|---------|
| storage1 | Azure Storage account | Student course materials and media |
| VNET1 | Virtual network | Network infrastructure for training systems |
| VM1 | Azure virtual machine | Learning management system server |
| VM1Managed | Managed disk for VM1 | Storage for the LMS virtual machine |
| RVAULT1 | Recovery Services vault | Backup and site recovery for VM1 |

You need to identify which of these educational infrastructure resources can be moved from AZPT1 to AZPT2 to complete the subscription reorganization.

Which resources can be moved to subscription AZPT2?
