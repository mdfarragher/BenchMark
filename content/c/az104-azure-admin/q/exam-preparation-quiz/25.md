title: "Configure Container Instance For Startup Parameters And Secure Values"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
  - id: "answer1"
    title: "Environment variables"
    correct: true
    explain: "Environment variables are the correct solution for both configuration parameters and secure values. Azure Container Instances supports both regular environment variables for configuration and secure environment variables for sensitive data like passwords and keys."
  - id: "answer2"
    title: "Command override"
    correct: false
    explain: "Command override allows you to specify a different command to run when the container starts, but it doesn't provide a secure way to pass configuration parameters or sensitive values to the container application."
  - id: "answer3"
    title: "Tags"
    correct: false
    explain: "Tags are metadata used for organizing and managing Azure resources. They are not accessible by the container application and cannot be used to pass configuration parameters or secure values during startup."
  - id: "answer4"
    title: "Customer-managed keys"
    correct: false
    explain: "Customer-managed keys are used for encryption at rest of Azure resources. They don't provide a mechanism for passing configuration parameters or secure values to containers during startup."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, is modernizing their educational applications by containerizing their student assessment platform using Azure Container Instances. As the newly hired application modernization specialist for MDFT Pro, you need to deploy a container named cont1 that hosts their quiz engine application under direction from Mark, the CTO and boss at MDFT Pro. 

The containerized application requires specific configuration parameters such as database connection strings, API endpoints, and feature flags to be available during startup. Additionally, the application needs secure access to sensitive values like API keys, database passwords, and encryption certificates that must be protected from exposure in logs or container metadata. The solution must ensure that both regular configuration settings and sensitive security credentials are properly provided to the container during its initialization phase.

What should you configure for cont1 to meet both the configuration parameter and secure value requirements?
