title: "Generate Department Cost Report Using Resource Tags"
type: "question"
layout: "multiple"
answers:
  - id: "answer1"
    title: "Assign a tag to each resource"
    correct: true
    explain: "Assigning tags to each resource is essential for cost tracking by department. Tags applied at the resource level provide the most granular cost attribution and ensure accurate departmental cost allocation."
  - id: "answer2"
    title: "From the Cost analysis blade, filter the view by tag"
    correct: true
    explain: "Filtering the Cost analysis view by tag allows you to see costs grouped by the department tags you've assigned. This is the key step to generate department-specific cost breakdowns from the tagged resources."
  - id: "answer3"
    title: "Download the usage report"
    correct: true
    explain: "Downloading the usage report captures the filtered cost data for sharing with the finance department. This provides them with a detailed breakdown of costs by department based on the tag filtering."
  - id: "answer4"
    title: "Assign a tag to each resource group"
    correct: false
    explain: "Assigning tags only to resource groups provides less accurate cost tracking since resources within a group might belong to different departments. Resource-level tagging is more precise for departmental cost allocation."
  - id: "answer5"
    title: "Open the Resource costs blade of each resource group"
    correct: false
    explain: "Opening individual resource group cost blades doesn't provide department-level aggregation across multiple resource groups. This approach would be inefficient and wouldn't leverage the power of tag-based cost filtering."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, operates a shared Azure subscription that supports four different departments: Course Development, Student Services, IT Operations, and Marketing. Each department utilizes resources across multiple resource groups for their specific educational functions - Course Development manages learning content systems, Student Services handles enrollment platforms, IT Operations maintains infrastructure, and Marketing runs promotional websites. You have been hired by Mark, the CEO and boss at MDFT Pro, to work as a cloud administrator. Claire, who reports to Mark as Financial Controller at MDFT Pro, needs to provide accurate cost allocation reports to each department head for budget planning and cost optimization. The current subscription contains 10 resource groups with resources distributed across departments, making it challenging to determine which costs belong to which department without proper tracking mechanisms.

The finance team requires a detailed report showing exactly how much each department spent on Azure resources during the billing period, broken down by service type and resource usage. This information is critical for department budget reviews and future capacity planning decisions.

What sequence of actions should Claire perform to generate an accurate departmental cost report?
