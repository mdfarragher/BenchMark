title: "Deploy YAML File To AKS Cluster Using Kubectl"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
  - id: "answer1"
    title: "Yes"
    correct: true
    explain: "Running kubectl from Azure CLI is the correct approach to deploy YAML files to an AKS cluster. Azure CLI includes kubectl functionality and can authenticate with AKS clusters to deploy Kubernetes resources defined in YAML files."
  - id: "answer2"
    title: "No"
    correct: false
    explain: "This solution does meet the goal. The kubectl client is the standard tool for deploying YAML configurations to Kubernetes clusters, and Azure CLI provides kubectl capabilities for managing AKS resources."
  - id: "answer3"
    title: "Only with additional authentication"
    correct: false
    explain: "While authentication is required, Azure CLI handles AKS authentication seamlessly when properly configured. The kubectl client through Azure CLI can deploy YAML files without requiring separate authentication steps."
  - id: "answer4"
    title: "Only if the YAML file is stored in Azure"
    correct: false
    explain: "The location of the YAML file (local or Azure) doesn't affect the ability to deploy it using kubectl. The kubectl client can deploy YAML files regardless of where they are stored, as long as they're accessible during the deployment command."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, has modernized their educational platform infrastructure by implementing a containerized architecture using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). You have been hired by Mark, the Operations Manager,, to work as a cloud administrator. Mark has deployed an AKS cluster named AKS1 to host their microservices-based learning management system, student portal applications, and automated assessment tools. 

The development team has created Kubernetes deployment manifests in YAML format that define the configuration for their educational applications, including pod specifications, service definitions, and ingress rules for routing student traffic. These YAML files contain the complete infrastructure-as-code definitions needed to deploy their scalable training platform components to the AKS cluster.

Mark needs to deploy a YAML configuration file to AKS1 that contains the deployment specifications for their new quiz engine microservice, which will handle real-time student assessments and grade calculations.

Does using the kubectl client from Azure CLI meet the requirement to deploy the YAML file to AKS1?
