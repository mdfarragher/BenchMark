MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, has been storing vast amounts of educational content and student data across various Azure storage services to support their global online learning platform. You have been hired by Mark, the CEO and boss at MDFT Pro, to work as a cloud administrator. Claire, who reports to Mark as Data Management Director at MDFT Pro, needs to create a data archival strategy for compliance and backup purposes. The company's Azure subscription contains different types of data storage including course videos in blob containers, shared training materials in Azure Files, student records in SQL databases, and metadata in Azure Table storage. Due to the large volume of data (multiple terabytes), she plans to use Azure Import/Export service with job Export1 to efficiently transfer data to on-premises storage systems for long-term archival and disaster recovery purposes.

| Storage Name | Storage Type | Content |
|--------------|--------------|---------|
| container1 | Blob container | Course videos and training materials |
| share1 | Azure Files share | Shared documents and resources |
| DB1 | SQL database | Student enrollment and grade records |
| Table1 | Azure Table | Application metadata and logs |

Claire needs to determine which of these data sources can be exported using the Azure Import/Export service Export1 job.

Which data can be exported using Azure Import/Export service Export1?
