MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, frequently collaborates with external consultants and temporary staff on short-term educational projects. You have been hired by Mark, the CEO and boss at MDFT Pro, to work as a cloud administrator. Mark needs to provide three users (User1, User2, and User3) with temporary access to a SharePoint document library named Library1 that contains sensitive course development materials and curriculum designs. 

These users are working on a 6-month project to develop new certification training programs, but their access should be automatically revoked after the project completion to maintain security compliance. The company requires an automated solution that will remove access after 180 days without manual intervention, ensuring that temporary access doesn't become permanent and create security risks.

The solution must create groups that can grant SharePoint access while automatically cleaning up after the specified time period, supporting the company's security policy of least-privilege access and automatic access review cycles.

Which two group types should Mark create to meet these requirements?
