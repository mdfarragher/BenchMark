      title: "Yes"
      correct: true
      explain: "After the alert processing rule suppression window ends (August 13, 2025), all alert rules return to normal operation. Administrative operations performed after this date will trigger the AdminAlert rule and send notifications through the Notify-Trainers action group. Adding a tag to a resource group is considered an administrative operation."

      title: "No"
      correct: false
      explain: "This is incorrect because the suppression window ends on August 13, 2025, and the administrative operation occurs on August 15, 2025. Since the operation happens after the suppression period, notifications will be sent normally according to the configured alert rule and action group."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, operates an Azure subscription called Students-Sub that contains various educational resources. As a newly hired Azure administrator for MDFT Pro, you are responsible for managing the monitoring and alerting infrastructure. Mark, the boss at MDFT Pro, has configured a comprehensive alerting system to track administrative changes across all training resources, with temporary suppression during maintenance windows. The subscription contains the following resources:

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Training-RG | Resource group containing student course materials |
| Notify-Trainers | Action group that sends email notifications to mark@mdftpro.com |

The Students-Sub subscription has been configured with the following alert rule:
- **Name**: AdminAlert
- **Scope**: All resource groups in Students-Sub (including future resources)
- **Condition**: All administrative operations
- **Actions**: Notify-Trainers

Additionally, there is an alert processing rule configured for planned maintenance:
- **Name**: MaintenanceWindow
- **Scope**: Students-Sub
- **Rule type**: Suppress notifications
- **Schedule**: August 10, 2025 to August 13, 2025

If you add a tag to the Training-RG resource group on August 15, 2025 (after the maintenance window), will an email notification be sent to mark@mdftpro.com?
