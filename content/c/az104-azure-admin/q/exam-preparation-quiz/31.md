MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, is scaling their online learning platform to handle increasing student enrollments across multiple regions. You have been hired by Mark, the CEO and boss at MDFT Pro, to work as a cloud administrator. Mark needs to deploy several Azure virtual machines running Windows Server 2019 in a virtual machine scale set using an ARM template. These VMs will host their distributed learning management system that serves educational content to thousands of students globally. The architecture requires NGINX to be installed and configured on all virtual machines to act as a reverse proxy and load balancer for their educational web applications. The solution must ensure that NGINX is automatically available and properly configured on every VM instance when they are provisioned by the scale set, whether during initial deployment or when auto-scaling creates new instances to handle increased student traffic.

What should Mark use to ensure NGINX is available on all virtual machines in the scale set after they are deployed?
