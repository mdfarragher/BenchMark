title: "Connect Virtual Machine To Different Virtual Network"

answers:
  - id: "answer1"
    title: "Yes"
    correct: false
    explain: "Moving VM1 to a different resource group doesn't change its network connectivity. Adding a network interface to VM1 doesn't automatically connect it to VNET2, and cross-region networking requires additional configuration like VNet peering or VPN connectivity."
  - id: "answer2"
    title: "No"
    correct: true
    explain: "This solution doesn't meet the goal. Simply moving the VM and adding a network interface won't connect VM1 to VNET2 in East Asia. Cross-region connectivity requires VNet peering, VPN gateway, or other networking solutions to enable communication between regions."

    title: "Only with VNet peering configured"
    correct: false
    explain: "Even with VNet peering, the proposed solution of just moving the VM and adding a network interface is insufficient. The VM would need proper network configuration and the VNet peering would need to be established first."
  - id: "answer4"
    title: "Only if VM1 is redeployed"
    correct: false
    explain: "Redeployment alone wouldn't solve the fundamental issue. VM1 is in West US and VNET2 is in East Asia, so cross-region connectivity solutions are required regardless of deployment method."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, operates a global educational infrastructure with resources distributed across multiple Azure regions to provide optimal performance for students worldwide. You have been hired by Mark, the CEO and boss at MDFT Pro, to work as a cloud administrator. 

Claire, who reports to Mark as Network Architecture Manager at MDFT Pro, needs to establish connectivity between their learning management system components located in different regions. The company has VM1 running their student portal application in West US connected to VNET1, and they need to connect it to VNET2 in East Asia where their assessment database and grading systems are located.

| Resource Name | Type | Region | Current State |
|---------------|------|--------|---------------|
| RG1 | Resource group | West US | Contains VM1, VNET1, storage1 |
| RG2 | Resource group | East Asia | Contains VNET2, storage2 |
| VM1 | Virtual machine | West US | Connected to VNET1 |
| VNET1 | Virtual network | West US | Hosts student portal systems |
| VNET2 | Virtual network | East Asia | Hosts assessment and grading systems |

The proposed solution is to move VM1 to resource group RG2 and then add a new network interface to VM1.

Does this solution meet the goal of connecting VM1 to VNET2?
