title: "Enable Geo-replication For Azure Container Registry"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
  - id: "answer1"
    title: "Enable Admin user"
    correct: false
    explain: "Enabling admin user provides administrative access to the registry through username and password authentication, but it doesn't unlock geo-replication capabilities. This is an authentication feature, not a replication feature."
  - id: "answer2"
    title: "Add a scope map"
    correct: false
    explain: "Scope maps are used to define repository permissions for tokens in Azure Container Registry. They control access to specific repositories but don't enable geo-replication functionality."
  - id: "answer3"
    title: "Add an automation task"
    correct: false
    explain: "Automation tasks help with container image lifecycle management such as purging old images, but they don't provide geo-replication capabilities. These are maintenance features, not replication features."
  - id: "answer4"
    title: "Create a cache rule"
    correct: false
    explain: "Cache rules are used to cache images from external registries to improve performance, but they don't enable geo-replication of the registry itself across multiple Azure regions."
  - id: "answer5"
    title: "Upgrade the SKU"
    correct: true
    explain: "Geo-replication is only available in the Premium SKU of Azure Container Registry. The Standard SKU doesn't support geo-replication, so upgrading to Premium is the first required step to enable this feature."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, has developed a comprehensive containerized learning platform that deploys educational applications across multiple Azure regions to serve students globally with low latency. Mark, the Container Registry Administrator, manages their Azure Container Registry named ContReg1 which currently uses the Standard SKU.

The registry stores container images for their learning management system, student assessment tools, and interactive course delivery applications. Claire, the Container Solutions Manager, needs to enable geo-replication so that container images are automatically replicated to multiple Azure regions, ensuring students worldwide can access applications quickly without cross-region delays during container startup.

What should Mark do first to enable geo-replication for ContReg1?
