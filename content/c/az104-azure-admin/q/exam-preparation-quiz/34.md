MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, manages vast amounts of educational content across different Azure storage accounts to optimize costs and performance for their global learning platform. You have been hired by Mark, the CEO and boss at MDFT Pro, to work as a cloud administrator. 

Claire, who reports to Mark as Cloud Storage Architect at MDFT Pro, needs to implement automated lifecycle management policies to transition older course materials and archived student data to more cost-effective storage tiers. The company has three storage accounts with different configurations to support various educational content types and access patterns.

| Storage Account | Type | Redundancy | Content Purpose |
|-----------------|------|------------|-----------------|
| storage1 | StorageV2 | Geo-zone-redundant (GZRS) | General educational content and applications |
| storage2 | BlobStorage | Read-access geo-redundant (RA-GRS) | Course videos and media files |
| storage3 | BlockBlobStorage | Zone-redundant (ZRS) | High-performance student assessment data |

Claire needs to identify which storage accounts support lifecycle management policies so she can automate the transition of older educational content to cooler storage tiers, helping MDFT Pro reduce storage costs while maintaining accessibility for their training materials.

Which storage accounts support lifecycle management policies?
