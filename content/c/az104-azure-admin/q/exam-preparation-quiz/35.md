MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, needs to implement a comprehensive data archival strategy for their educational content to comply with regulatory requirements and optimize long-term storage costs. You have been hired by Mark, the CEO and boss at MDFT Pro, to work as a cloud administrator. 

Mark must identify which storage accounts can move data to the Archive access tier for long-term retention of student records, course materials, and compliance documentation. The company maintains three different storage accounts with specific configurations optimized for different educational content types and access patterns.

| Storage Account | Type | Redundancy | Content Purpose |
|-----------------|------|------------|-----------------|
| storage1 | StorageV2 | Geo-zone-redundant (GZRS) | General educational content and applications |
| storage2 | BlobStorage | Read-access geo-redundant (RA-GRS) | Course videos and media files |
| storage3 | BlockBlobStorage | Zone-redundant (ZRS) | High-performance student assessment data |

The Archive tier provides the lowest storage cost but requires several hours for data rehydration when accessed. Mark needs to determine which storage accounts support moving data to the Archive access tier for their long-term data retention strategy.

Which storage accounts support moving data to the Archive access tier?
