title: "Create User Accounts In External Azure AD Tenant"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
  - id: "answer1"
    title: "Yes"
    correct: false
    explain: "User4 has the Owner role with Azure Subscription scope, which provides access to subscription resources but not to Azure Active Directory tenant management. Creating user accounts requires Azure AD permissions, not subscription permissions."
  - id: "answer2"
    title: "No"
    correct: true
    explain: "User4 cannot create user accounts in the external tenant because the Owner role is scoped to the Azure subscription, not Azure Active Directory. Creating users in Azure AD requires appropriate directory roles like User Administrator or Global Administrator."
  - id: "answer3"
    title: "Only with additional permissions"
    correct: false
    explain: "While additional permissions would be needed, the question asks if the current solution meets the goal. User4's current Owner role scope is insufficient for Azure AD user creation, so the solution doesn't work as presented."
  - id: "answer4"
    title: "Only in the original tenant"
    correct: false
    explain: "User4's Owner role is scoped to the Azure subscription, not to either Azure AD tenant. This role doesn't provide user creation capabilities in any Azure AD tenant, including the original one."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, is expanding their educational services through partnerships and acquisitions. The company's IT team manages multiple Azure Active Directory tenants to segregate different business units and educational programs. User1, who has Global Administrator rights, has created a new Azure AD tenant named external.contoso.onmicrosoft.com to support a newly acquired training subsidiary. 

You have been hired by Mark, the CEO and boss at MDFT Pro, to work as a cloud administrator. Claire, who reports to Mark as Identity Management Specialist at MDFT Pro, needs to provision user accounts in this external tenant for the new subsidiary's trainers and administrative staff who will manage specialized certification programs.

| User | Role | Scope |
|------|------|-------|
| User1 | Global Administrator | Azure Active Directory |
| User2 | Global Administrator | Azure Active Directory |
| User3 | User Administrator | Azure Active Directory |
| User4 | Owner | Azure Subscription |

The proposed solution is to instruct User4 to create the user accounts in the external tenant.

Does this solution meet the goal of creating new user accounts in external.contoso.onmicrosoft.com?
