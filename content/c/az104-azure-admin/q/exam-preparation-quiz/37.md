title: "Complete Azure Policy For Resource Group Tag Enforcement"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
  - id: "answer1"
    title: "Append"
    correct: false
    explain: "The Append effect adds properties to resources during creation, but it cannot modify existing tags or enforce specific tag values. This effect is used to add new properties, not to validate compliance with tag requirements."
  - id: "answer2"
    title: "Deny"
    correct: false
    explain: "The Deny effect prevents resource creation or modification, but would block resource group creation entirely if the tag is missing. This doesn't allow creation from the portal or provide accurate compliance reporting."
  - id: "answer3"
    title: "Modify"
    correct: false
    explain: "The Modify effect can alter resource properties during creation or updates, but it's more complex and typically used for adding or changing properties rather than simple compliance reporting."
  - id: "answer4"
    title: "Audit"
    correct: true
    explain: "The Audit effect allows resources to be created but marks them as non-compliant in compliance reports when they don't meet policy requirements. This enables portal creation while providing accurate compliance reporting for missing organization tags."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, needs to implement governance policies across their Azure environment to ensure proper resource organization and cost tracking for their educational services. You have been hired by Mark, the CEO and boss at MDFT Pro, to work as a cloud administrator. 

Mark is creating a custom Azure Policy to enforce tagging standards for resource groups. The company requires that every resource group has an "organization" tag set to "MDFT Pro" to enable accurate cost allocation and compliance reporting for their training programs. The policy must allow resource groups to be created through the Azure portal while ensuring that compliance reports accurately reflect which resource groups are missing the required tag.

```json
{
  "mode": "all",
  "policyRule": {
    "if": {
      "allOf": [
        {
          "field": "tags['organization']",
          "notEquals": "MDFT Pro"
        },
        {
          "field": "type",
          "equals": "Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups"
        }
      ]
    },
    "then": {
      "effect": "__________"
    }
  }
}
```

What effect should Mark specify to meet all the requirements: allow portal creation, ensure compliance reporting accuracy, and enforce the organization tag standard?
