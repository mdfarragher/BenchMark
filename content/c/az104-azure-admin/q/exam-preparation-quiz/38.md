title: "Complete Azure Policy Resource Type Field For Resource Groups"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
  - id: "answer1"
    title: "Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups"
    correct: false
    explain: "This path includes unnecessary subscription scope information. For Azure Policy resource type targeting, the standard resource type path is sufficient and more commonly used."
  - id: "answer2"
    title: "Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups"
    correct: true
    explain: "This is the correct resource type for targeting resource groups in Azure Policy definitions. It follows the standard Azure resource type format of {resourceProvider}/{resourceType} for resource groups."
  - id: "answer3"
    title: "resourceGroups"
    correct: false
    explain: "This is too abbreviated and doesn't include the Microsoft namespace or resource provider information. Azure Policy requires the full resource type specification for proper resource identification."
  - id: "answer4"
    title: "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines"
    correct: false
    explain: "This is the resource type for virtual machines, not resource groups. The policy is specifically targeting resource groups for tag enforcement, so this type is completely incorrect for this scenario."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, continues to refine their Azure governance policies to ensure proper resource management across their educational infrastructure. You have been hired by Mark, the CEO and boss at MDFT Pro, to work as a cloud administrator. 

Claire, who reports to Mark as Compliance Manager at MDFT Pro, is working on completing the custom policy definition that will enforce the organization tag requirement for all resource groups. The policy needs to specifically target resource groups to ensure that each new resource group created for training programs, student services, or administrative functions has the proper organizational tagging in place for cost tracking and compliance reporting.

```json
{
  "mode": "all",
  "policyRule": {
    "if": {
      "allOf": [
        {
          "field": "tags['organization']",
          "notEquals": "MDFT Pro"
        },
        {
          "field": "type",
          "equals": "__________"
        }
      ]
    },
    "then": {
      "effect": "Audit"
    }
  }
}
```

The policy condition needs to identify the correct resource type to target resource groups specifically. What value should Claire specify in the "equals" field to properly target resource groups in this policy?
