MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, maintains strict security governance for their Azure Active Directory tenant to protect sensitive student data and educational intellectual property. Mark, the Security Review Administrator, has configured Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to manage elevated permissions across their educational platform.

The company currently has 10 users assigned the Security Administrator role who have permissions to manage security settings and oversee threat protection for their learning management systems. As part of their quarterly security review process, Mark's colleague Claire needs to verify whether these users still require the Security Administrator role or if their responsibilities have changed, allowing for role assignments to be reduced following the principle of least privilege.

What should Mark do to verify whether the users still require the Security Administrator role?
