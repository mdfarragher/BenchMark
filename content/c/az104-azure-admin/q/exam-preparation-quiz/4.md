    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Mark, Claire, and Jessica"
      correct: false
      explain: "This is incorrect because not all users require domain-joined computer authentication. While Mark must change his password at next logon (which requires domain authentication), Claire and Jessica have different requirements that don't necessarily require domain-joined computers."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Claire only"
      correct: false
      explain: "This is incorrect because Claire's account is configured for reversible encryption storage, which doesn't require a domain-joined computer for authentication. This setting affects password storage method but not the authentication location requirement."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Mark only"
      correct: true
      explain: "Mark's account is configured with 'User must change password at next logon,' which requires interactive domain authentication through a domain-joined computer. This setting cannot be satisfied through cloud-only authentication methods when Azure AD Connect is involved."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Claire and Jessica only"
      correct: false
      explain: "This is incorrect because Jessica's smart card requirement can potentially be satisfied through certificate-based authentication methods that don't require domain-joined computers, depending on the infrastructure configuration."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "Mark and Jessica only"
      correct: false
      explain: "This is incorrect because Jessica's smart card authentication, while requiring special configuration, doesn't necessarily mandate a domain-joined computer if proper certificate-based authentication is configured for Azure AD."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, operates a hybrid Active Directory environment where the on-premises domain mdftpro.local is synchronized to Azure Active Directory. As the newly hired system administrator, you need to understand the authentication requirements for different user account configurations. 

Mark, the CEO at MDFT Pro, has created several user accounts with specific security requirements for the training staff. Password writeback is currently disabled in the hybrid configuration. The following user accounts have been created in the mdftpro.local domain:

| Name | Account Option |
|------|----------------|
| Mark | User must change password at next logon |
| Claire | Store password using reversible encryption |
| Jessica | A smart card is required for interactive logon |

Each account option has different implications for where and how users can authenticate to access MDFT Pro's training resources and systems.

Which users must sign in from a computer joined to the mdftpro.local domain?
