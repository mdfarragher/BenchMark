title: "Create Network Interface For Virtual Machine In Correct Location"

answers:
  - id: "answer1"
    title: "Yes"
    correct: true
    explain: "Creating NIC2 in RG1 and West US meets the goal. Network interfaces can be created in any resource group and region, and NIC2 can then be attached to VM1 regardless of the resource group locations, as long as they're in compatible regions."
  - id: "answer2"
    title: "No"
    correct: false
    explain: "This solution does meet the goal. Network interfaces don't need to be in the same resource group as the virtual machine they serve. The location and network configuration are the primary concerns for NIC functionality."

    title: "Only if VNET1 is in West US"
    correct: false
    explain: "The solution doesn't depend on VNET1's location. The question states VM1 connects to VNET2 via NIC1, and NIC2 would be an additional interface that can connect to any compatible virtual network in the region."

    title: "Only if moved to RG2"
    correct: false
    explain: "Network interfaces don't need to be in the same resource group as the VM. Creating NIC2 in RG1 is perfectly valid and allows the interface to be attached to VM1 in RG2."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, is expanding their virtual machine networking configuration to support enhanced connectivity for their educational infrastructure. You have been hired by Mark, the CEO and boss at MDFT Pro, to work as a cloud administrator. Claire, who reports to Mark as Network Infrastructure Specialist at MDFT Pro, needs to add a second network interface (NIC2) to an existing virtual machine (VM1) that currently hosts their student assessment platform. VM1 is located in resource group RG2 in West US and currently connects to VNET2 through network interface NIC1. The additional network interface will provide connectivity to a separate training network for isolated testing environments used by their certification program instructors.

| Resource Name | Type | Location | Resource Group |
|---------------|------|----------|----------------|
| RG1 | Resource group | East US | Not applicable |
| RG2 | Resource group | West Europe | Not applicable |
| RG3 | Resource group | North Europe | Not applicable |
| VNET1 | Virtual network | Central US | RG1 |
| VM1 | Virtual machine | West US | RG2 |

The proposed solution is to create the new network interface NIC2 in resource group RG1 and place it in the West US region.

Does this solution meet the goal of creating NIC2 for VM1?
