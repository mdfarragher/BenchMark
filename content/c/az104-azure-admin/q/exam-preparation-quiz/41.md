MDFT Pro, a comprehensive technology training agency, has been deploying various Azure resources to support their cloud certification courses. Mark, the Cloud Infrastructure Manager, needs to audit their resource deployment timeline for compliance reporting. Their Azure subscription named Subscription1 contains a resource group called RG1, which hosts training lab environments deployed using ARM templates for their Azure Administrator certification program. The compliance team requires detailed information about when each resource was originally created to track deployment patterns and ensure proper resource lifecycle management across their student training environments.

Claire, the Senior Azure Trainer, suggests using the Azure portal to find this information quickly. The proposed solution is to navigate to the Subscriptions blade in the Azure portal, select Subscription1, and then click on the Resource providers section to view the date and time when resources were created in RG1.

Does this solution meet the goal of viewing resource creation timestamps?
