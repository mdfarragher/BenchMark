    title: "The App Service plan remains in West Europe. Policy2 applies to WebApp1."
    correct: true
    explain: "Correct. When moving a web app between resource groups, the App Service plan stays in its original region. The web app inherits the policies from its new resource group (RG2), so Policy2 applies."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, operates a comprehensive web-based learning management system to deliver their Azure certification courses. The Azure subscription contains multiple resource groups across different regions to support global training delivery.

Mark, the Resource Migration Specialist, manages three resource groups with specific policies:

| Resource Group | Azure Region | Applied Policy |
|---------------|--------------|----------------|
| RG1 | West Europe | Policy1 |
| RG2 | North Europe | Policy2 |
| RG3 | France Central | Policy3 |

Their primary learning management system, WebApp1, is currently deployed in RG1. Due to organizational restructuring, Claire, the Application Migration Manager, needs to move WebApp1 from RG1 to RG2 to consolidate management responsibilities with the Northern European training division.

What is the effect when WebApp1 is moved from RG1 to RG2?
