MDFT Pro, a leading technology training organization, operates an extensive Azure infrastructure to support their comprehensive certification programs. Mark, the Cloud Cost Management Specialist, oversees their Azure subscription that contains a resource group named RG1 hosting 100 virtual machines used across different departments for various training scenarios. The organization has three distinct cost centers that need precise budget allocation and expense tracking: Manufacturing (supporting industrial IoT training programs), Sales (hosting customer demo environments), and Finance (running ERP and business application training labs).

Claire, the Financial Operations Manager, requires detailed cost allocation reporting to understand departmental cloud spending and optimize budget distribution across training programs. The accounting team needs to track which virtual machines belong to each cost center to ensure accurate chargeback mechanisms and support departmental budget planning for the upcoming fiscal year.

What should Mark do to associate each virtual machine to a specific cost center for accurate cost allocation and reporting?
