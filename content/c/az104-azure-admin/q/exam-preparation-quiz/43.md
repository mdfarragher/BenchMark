MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, operates an extensive Azure infrastructure to support their comprehensive certification programs. The organization has an Azure subscription containing a resource group named RG1 with 100 virtual machines used across different departments for training scenarios.

Mark, the Cost Allocation Manager, needs to organize resources across three distinct cost centers: Manufacturing (industrial IoT training programs), Sales (customer demo environments), and Finance (ERP and business application training labs). Mark's colleague Claire requires detailed cost allocation reporting to understand departmental cloud spending and support accurate chargeback mechanisms for budget planning.

What should Mark do to associate each virtual machine to a specific cost center for accurate cost allocation and reporting?
