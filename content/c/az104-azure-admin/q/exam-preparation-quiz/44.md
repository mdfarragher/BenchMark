MDFT Pro training academy maintains strict governance controls across their Azure infrastructure to ensure compliance with their educational standards and regulatory requirements. You have been hired by Mark, the CEO and boss at MDFT Pro, to work as a cloud administrator. 

Mark has implemented a comprehensive Azure Policy framework to control resource deployment across their subscription. Claire, who reports to Mark as Database Training Specialist, needs to understand the impact of a specific policy that has been implemented to restrict certain resource types while maintaining flexibility for specialized training scenarios.

The policy configuration currently in place has the following specifications:

| Policy Property | Value |
|----------------|--------|
| Scope | Subscription1 |
| Exclusions | Subscription1/ContosoRG1 |
| Policy definition | Not allowed resource types |
| Assignment name | Not allowed resource types |
| Assigned by | admin1@contoso.com |
| Parameters | Not allowed resource types: Microsoft.Sql/servers |

This policy was implemented to prevent unauthorized database deployments while maintaining a controlled environment for their SQL Server certification training program, which requires a dedicated resource group with different governance rules.

What is the effect of this policy configuration on Azure SQL Server creation?
