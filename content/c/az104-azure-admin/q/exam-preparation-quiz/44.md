    title: "You can create Azure SQL servers in ContosoRG1 only"
    correct: true
    explain: "Correct. The policy prevents creation of SQL servers across the entire subscription, but ContosoRG1 is excluded from this restriction, making it the only place where SQL servers can be created."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, maintains strict governance controls across their Azure infrastructure to ensure compliance with their educational standards. Mark, the Policy Compliance Officer, has implemented a comprehensive Azure Policy framework to control resource deployment across their subscription.

Mark's colleague Claire needs to understand the impact of a specific policy that restricts certain resource types while maintaining flexibility for specialized training scenarios. The policy configuration has these specifications:

| Policy Property | Value |
|----------------|--------|
| Scope | Subscription1 |
| Exclusions | Subscription1/ContosoRG1 |
| Policy definition | Not allowed resource types |
| Parameters | Not allowed resource types: Microsoft.Sql/servers |

This policy was implemented to prevent unauthorized database deployments while maintaining a controlled environment for their SQL Server certification training program, which requires a dedicated resource group with different governance rules.

What is the effect of this policy configuration on Azure SQL Server creation?
