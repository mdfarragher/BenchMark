Mark works as a Cloud Training Manager at MDFT Pro, a leading technology training agency. He's designing a hands-on Azure administration course where students will learn to manage permissions for development teams. In this scenario, MDFT Pro has an Azure Active Directory tenant named Adatum and an Azure subscription called Subscription1. The company has created a group called Developers for their software development training program. Claire, who serves as the Lead Azure Instructor, needs to demonstrate how to grant proper permissions so that the Developers group can create Azure Logic Apps within a resource group named Dev for their integration projects.

The proposed solution assigns the DevTest Labs User role to the Developers group on Subscription1.

Does this meet the goal?
