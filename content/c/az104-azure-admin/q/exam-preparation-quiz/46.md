title: "Azure Logic Apps Role Assignment For Development Team"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
  - id: "answer1"
    title: "Yes"
    correct: false
    explain: "The DevTest Labs User role is designed for Azure DevTest Labs resources, not for creating Logic Apps. This role doesn't provide the necessary permissions to create Azure Logic Apps in a resource group."
  - id: "answer2"
    title: "No"
    correct: true
    explain: "The DevTest Labs User role is incorrect for this scenario. To create Logic Apps, the Developers group needs either the Logic App Contributor role or Contributor role on the resource group, not the DevTest Labs User role."
  - id: "answer3"
    title: "Only with additional permissions"
    correct: false
    explain: "While additional permissions would be needed, the question asks if the current solution meets the goal. The DevTest Labs User role alone cannot create Logic Apps regardless of additional permissions."
  - id: "answer4"
    title: "Only for existing Logic Apps"
    correct: false
    explain: "The DevTest Labs User role is not designed for Logic Apps management at all. It provides access to DevTest Labs resources, not Logic Apps, whether new or existing."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, is designing a hands-on Azure administration course where students learn to manage permissions for development teams. The company has an Azure Active Directory tenant named Adatum and an Azure subscription called Subscription1.

Mark, the Permissions Training Coordinator, has created a group called Developers for their software development training program. Claire needs to demonstrate how to grant proper permissions so that the Developers group can create Azure Logic Apps within a resource group named Dev for their integration projects. The proposed solution assigns the DevTest Labs User role to the Developers group on Subscription1.

Does this meet the goal?
