Claire serves as the Identity and Access Management Instructor at MDFT Pro, a premier cloud training organization. She's conducting a practical workshop on Azure Active Directory administration for her advanced students. In this training scenario, MDFT Pro has an Azure Active Directory tenant containing 5,000 user accounts representing various employees, students, and training staff. Claire has just created a new user account named AdminUser1 for demonstration purposes and needs to show her students the proper method to assign the User Administrator role to this account. This role will allow AdminUser1 to manage other user accounts within the tenant, which is essential for understanding Azure AD administration principles.

What should Claire do from the user account properties to assign the User Administrator administrative role to AdminUser1?
