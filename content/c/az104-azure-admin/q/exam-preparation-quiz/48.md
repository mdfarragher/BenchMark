answers:
  - id: "answer1"
    title: "The Azure Portal"
    correct: false
    explain: "While the Azure Portal can be used to create DNS zones and records, it would require manual recreation of 1,000 DNS records, which does not minimize administrative effort as required."
  - id: "answer2"
    title: "The DNS Manager console"
    correct: false
    explain: "The DNS Manager console is used for on-premises DNS management but cannot directly migrate zones to Azure DNS. It lacks the capability to export zones in a format suitable for Azure DNS import."
  - id: "answer3"
    title: "Azure PowerShell"
    correct: false
    explain: "While Azure PowerShell can manage Azure DNS zones and records, Azure CLI provides more streamlined commands for DNS zone migration and is generally more efficient for this specific task."
  - id: "answer4"
    title: "Azure CLI"
    correct: true
    explain: "Azure CLI is the most efficient tool for this migration. It provides commands to export DNS zones from on-premises and import them into Azure DNS with minimal scripting, significantly reducing administrative effort compared to manual methods."

You have been hired by Mark, the CEO and boss at MDFT Pro, to work as a cloud administrator at this comprehensive technology training company. Mark is preparing a real-world demonstration for his hybrid cloud course students about migrating DNS infrastructure from on-premises to Azure. In this training scenario, MDFT Pro has an Azure subscription named Subscription1 and maintains two on-premises Windows Server 2016 systems: Server1 and Server2. Server1 functions as the primary DNS server hosting the adatum.com zone, which contains 1,000 DNS records representing the company's extensive training portal infrastructure. Server2 serves as the management workstation, equipped with essential tools including the DNS Manager console, Azure PowerShell, and Azure CLI 2.0. Claire, who reports to Mark as Network Services Instructor, needs to demonstrate the most efficient method to migrate the adatum.com zone to Azure DNS within Subscription1 while minimizing administrative overhead.

The available tools on Server2 include:
- DNS Manager console
- Azure PowerShell  
- Azure CLI 2.0

What should be used to move the adatum.com zone to Subscription1 with minimal administrative effort?
