layout: "single"
answers:
  - id: "answer1"
    title: "The Azure Portal"
    correct: false
    explain: "While the Azure Portal can be used to create DNS zones and records, it would require manual recreation of 1,000 DNS records, which does not minimize administrative effort as required."
  - id: "answer2"
    title: "The DNS Manager console"
    correct: false
    explain: "The DNS Manager console is used for on-premises DNS management but cannot directly migrate zones to Azure DNS. It lacks the capability to export zones in a format suitable for Azure DNS import."
  - id: "answer3"
    title: "Azure PowerShell"
    correct: false
    explain: "While Azure PowerShell can manage Azure DNS zones and records, Azure CLI provides more streamlined commands for DNS zone migration and is generally more efficient for this specific task."
  - id: "answer4"
    title: "Azure CLI"
    correct: true
    explain: "Azure CLI is the most efficient tool for this migration. It provides commands to export DNS zones from on-premises and import them into Azure DNS with minimal scripting, significantly reducing administrative effort compared to manual methods."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, is preparing a real-world demonstration about migrating DNS infrastructure from on-premises to Azure. Mark, the DNS Infrastructure Analyst, maintains two on-premises Windows Server 2016 systems: Server1 and Server2.

Server1 functions as the primary DNS server hosting the adatum.com zone with 1,000 DNS records. Server2 serves as the management workstation equipped with DNS Manager console, Azure PowerShell, and Azure CLI 2.0. Claire, the Migration Strategy Specialist, needs to demonstrate the most efficient method to migrate the adatum.com zone to Azure DNS while minimizing administrative overhead.

What should be used to move the adatum.com zone to Subscription1 with minimal administrative effort?
