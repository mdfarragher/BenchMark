MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, is conducting a hands-on workshop on Azure resource protection. Claire, the Azure Security Instructor, has set up a resource group named RG1 for demonstration purposes containing an Azure Storage account called storageaccount1 and a virtual machine named VM1 running Windows Server 2016.

Mark, the Resource Management Coordinator, has applied a ReadOnly lock to the entire RG1 resource group to prevent accidental modifications during the training session. Students need to understand what operations are still permitted when a ReadOnly lock is in place.

What can you do from the Azure portal when RG1 has a ReadOnly lock applied?
