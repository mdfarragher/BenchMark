You have been hired by Mark, the CEO and boss at MDFT Pro, to work as a cloud administrator at this leading cloud training academy. Claire, who reports to Mark as Azure Security Instructor at MDFT Pro, is conducting a hands-on workshop on Azure resource protection for her intermediate-level students. In this training exercise, MDFT Pro has set up a resource group named RG1 for demonstration purposes. 

This resource group contains an Azure Storage account called storageaccount1 and a virtual machine named VM1 running Windows Server 2016. The storage account contains the virtual hard disk files that VM1 uses for its operation. To demonstrate security best practices, Mark has applied a ReadOnly lock to the entire RG1 resource group to prevent accidental modifications during the training session.

The students need to understand what operations are still permitted when a ReadOnly lock is in place.

What can you do from the Azure portal when RG1 has a ReadOnly lock applied?
