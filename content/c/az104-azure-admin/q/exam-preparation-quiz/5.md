answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Enable Application Logging"
      correct: false
      explain: "Application logging captures information generated by the web application code but does not provide detailed connection error information at the web server level. HTTP 500 errors are typically server-level connection issues that require web server logging to diagnose."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Create a Service Health alert in Azure Monitor"
      correct: false
      explain: "Service Health alerts notify about Azure service outages and planned maintenance but do not provide real-time connection error details for individual applications. This would not help developers troubleshoot specific HTTP 500 errors in their application."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Enable Web server logging"
      correct: true
      explain: "Web server logging captures detailed information about HTTP requests and responses, including connection errors, status codes, and server-level diagnostics. This provides developers with the comprehensive connection error details needed to troubleshoot HTTP 500 errors in real-time."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Create a workbook in Azure Monitor"
      correct: false
      explain: "Azure Monitor workbooks are useful for creating custom dashboards and reports but do not generate the underlying connection error data needed. You must first enable logging to capture the error details before you can visualize them in a workbook."
