title: "Configuring Azure Backup For Virtual Machine Protection"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
  - id: "answer1"
    title: "Store the backups in an Azure File Share and configure the protection of the VM with a batch job"
    correct: false
    explain: "Azure File Share is not a valid backup destination for Azure Backup. Batch jobs are for task scheduling, not backup protection. This combination cannot provide VM backup functionality."
  - id: "answer2"
    title: "Store the backups in a Storage Account and configure the protection of the VM with a recovery plan"
    correct: false
    explain: "While backups are ultimately stored in storage accounts, Azure Backup requires a Recovery Services Vault as the management layer. Recovery plans are used for disaster recovery orchestration, not backup scheduling."
  - id: "answer3"
    title: "Store the backups in a batch job and configure the protection of the VM with a Recovery Services Vault"
    correct: false
    explain: "Batch jobs cannot store backups as they are compute services for running tasks. Although Recovery Services Vault is correct for protection, the backup storage component is incorrect."
  - id: "answer4"
    title: "Store the backups in a blob container and configure the protection of the VM with a backup policy"
    correct: false
    explain: "Direct blob container storage bypasses Azure Backup's management features. While backup policies are used for scheduling, they must be associated with a Recovery Services Vault, not blob containers."
  - id: "answer5"
    title: "Store the backups in a Recovery Services Vault and configure the protection with a backup policy"
    correct: true
    explain: "This is the correct approach for Azure Backup. Recovery Services Vault manages backup storage and operations, while backup policies define scheduling (01:00 daily) and retention (30 days) requirements for VM protection."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, has recently purchased a new Azure subscription named Subscription1 for their expanding training infrastructure. Mark, the Backup Systems Specialist, is preparing a comprehensive lesson on Azure Backup strategies for his disaster recovery certification course. 

Claire has deployed a virtual machine called VM1 in this subscription to serve as a training server for student labs. However, VM1 is currently not protected by any backup solution. The company's backup policy requires that all critical systems be backed up daily at 01:00 AM with a retention period of 30 days to ensure business continuity.

What should be done to protect VM1 using Azure Backup with daily backups at 01:00 and 30-day retention?
