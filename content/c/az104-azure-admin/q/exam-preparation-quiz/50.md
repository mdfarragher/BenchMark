title: "Configuring Azure Backup For Virtual Machine Protection"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
  - id: "answer1"
    title: "Store the backups in an Azure File Share and configure the protection of the VM with a batch job"
    correct: false
    explain: "Azure File Share is not a valid backup destination for Azure Backup. Batch jobs are for task scheduling, not backup protection. This combination cannot provide VM backup functionality."
  - id: "answer2"
    title: "Store the backups in a Storage Account and configure the protection of the VM with a recovery plan"
    correct: false
    explain: "While backups are ultimately stored in storage accounts, Azure Backup requires a Recovery Services Vault as the management layer. Recovery plans are used for disaster recovery orchestration, not backup scheduling."
  - id: "answer3"
    title: "Store the backups in a batch job and configure the protection of the VM with a Recovery Services Vault"
    correct: false
    explain: "Batch jobs cannot store backups as they are compute services for running tasks. Although Recovery Services Vault is correct for protection, the backup storage component is incorrect."
  - id: "answer4"
    title: "Store the backups in a blob container and configure the protection of the VM with a backup policy"
    correct: false
    explain: "Direct blob container storage bypasses Azure Backup's management features. While backup policies are used for scheduling, they must be associated with a Recovery Services Vault, not blob containers."
  - id: "answer5"
    title: "Store the backups in a Recovery Services Vault and configure the protection with a backup policy"
    correct: true
    explain: "This is the correct approach for Azure Backup. Recovery Services Vault manages backup storage and operations, while backup policies define scheduling (01:00 daily) and retention (30 days) requirements for VM protection."

You have been hired by Mark, the CEO and boss at MDFT Pro, to work as a cloud administrator at this specialized cloud training organization. Mark is preparing a comprehensive lesson on Azure Backup strategies for his disaster recovery certification course. In this practical demonstration, MDFT Pro has recently purchased a new Azure subscription named Subscription1 for their expanding training infrastructure. Claire, who reports to Mark as Infrastructure Operations Trainer, has deployed a virtual machine called VM1 in this subscription to serve as a training server for student labs. However, VM1 is currently not protected by any backup solution, which poses a risk for the valuable training materials and configurations stored on it. The company's backup policy requires that all critical systems be backed up daily at 01:00 AM with a retention period of 30 days to ensure business continuity and compliance with their training delivery commitments.

Mark needs to demonstrate to his students the proper method to implement Azure Backup protection for VM1 according to company requirements.

What should be done to protect VM1 using Azure Backup with daily backups at 01:00 and 30-day retention?
