Mark works as a Cloud Infrastructure Trainer at MDFT Pro, an Azure training organization specializing in certification preparation courses. During a hands-on lab session for AZ-104 Azure Administrator certification, he's demonstrating virtual machine management scenarios to his students. MDFT Pro has deployed VM1, a critical training server, using a custom Azure Resource Manager template named ARM1.json to ensure consistent deployments across their training environment. 

Claire, the DevOps Training Coordinator, receives an Azure maintenance notification indicating that VM1 will be affected by planned host maintenance that could cause downtime during peak training hours. The maintenance is scheduled to occur during their busiest certification bootcamp session, which would disrupt learning for dozens of students. Mark needs to immediately demonstrate to his class how to proactively move VM1 to a different host to avoid the maintenance window and ensure uninterrupted access to the training resources.

The proposed solution is to navigate to VM1's Redeploy blade in the Azure portal and click the Redeploy button to immediately move the virtual machine to a different host.

Does this solution meet the goal of moving VM1 to a different host to avoid the maintenance?
