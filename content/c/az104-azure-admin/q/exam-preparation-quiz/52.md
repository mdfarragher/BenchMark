Mark serves as the Identity and Access Management Instructor at MDFT Pro, a comprehensive Azure training organization that provides enterprise-level certification courses. He's preparing an advanced lesson on Azure Active Directory device management for their AZ-104 Azure Administrator bootcamp program. MDFT Pro has recently upgraded their Azure subscription to include Azure AD Premium to support advanced identity features for their expanding training infrastructure. 

Claire, the Systems Security Trainer, needs to demonstrate proper device administration scenarios to students in their hybrid identity management course. The training environment includes multiple computers that will be joined to the Azure AD domain to simulate real-world enterprise scenarios. For security and management purposes, MDFT Pro requires that admin1@contoso.com, their designated training administrator account, be automatically configured as a local administrator on all computers that join their Azure AD domain. 

This will ensure consistent administrative access across all training devices while maintaining proper security controls and allowing instructors to perform necessary administrative tasks during hands-on exercises without requiring individual computer configuration.

Mark needs to show his students the proper Azure AD configuration that will automatically add admin1@contoso.com as an administrator on all computers joining their Azure AD domain.

What should be configured in Azure AD to achieve this requirement?
