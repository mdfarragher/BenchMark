Mark works as a Data Migration Specialist at MDFT Pro, a leading Azure training organization that helps enterprises transition to cloud infrastructure. He's conducting an advanced workshop on large-scale data migration strategies for their Azure Solutions Architect certification program. MDFT Pro has been contracted by a manufacturing client to help migrate their historical production data to Azure cloud storage. 

Claire, the Cloud Storage Instructor, is assisting with a complex data migration scenario where the client has 5 TB of critical business data that needs to be transferred to their Azure subscription efficiently and cost-effectively. The data includes years of production records, quality control documents, and compliance reports that are essential for their business operations. Due to the massive volume of data and the client's limited internet bandwidth at their manufacturing facility, traditional online transfer methods would take weeks and potentially impact their production systems. 

MDFT Pro needs to demonstrate the most appropriate Azure service for handling this large-scale data transfer scenario while minimizing downtime and ensuring data integrity. The client requires a solution that can handle the 5 TB transfer efficiently while maintaining security and compliance standards for their sensitive manufacturing data.

Mark needs to show his students the correct destination service that can be used with Azure Import/Export jobs for this bulk data transfer scenario.

What can be used as the destination for the imported data in an Azure Import/Export job?
