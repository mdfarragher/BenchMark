title: "Migrating Virtual Machine Protection Between Recovery Services Vaults"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
  - id: "answer1"
    title: "From the VM2 blade, click Disaster recovery, click Replication settings, and then select RSV2 as the Recovery Services vault"
    correct: false
    explain: "This option refers to Azure Site Recovery disaster recovery settings, not backup protection. Site Recovery and Azure Backup are different services with different vaults and configurations."
  - id: "answer2"
    title: "From the RSV1 blade, click Backup items and stop the VM2 backup"
    correct: true
    explain: "Before moving VM2 protection to RSV2, you must first stop the backup protection from the current vault (RSV1). This removes the existing backup policy and allows the VM to be protected by a different vault."
  - id: "answer3"
    title: "From the RSV1 blade, click Backup Jobs and export the VM2 backup"
    correct: false
    explain: "Exporting backup jobs only provides reports and history information. This action does not stop the current backup protection or enable the VM to be protected by another vault."
  - id: "answer4"
    title: "From the RSV2 blade, directly configure backup for VM2"
    correct: false
    explain: "You cannot directly configure backup for VM2 in RSV2 while it's still protected by RSV1. Azure Backup prevents a VM from being protected by multiple vaults simultaneously for data integrity reasons."

Mark serves as the Disaster Recovery Instructor at MDFT Pro, a specialized Azure training organization focusing on business continuity solutions. He's preparing a comprehensive lesson on Recovery Services vault management for their AZ-104 Azure Administrator certification course. MDFT Pro maintains a complex training environment with multiple Recovery Services vaults to demonstrate various backup and recovery scenarios to their students. Claire, who works as the Cloud Backup Specialist, has been managing the training infrastructure where VM1 and VM2 are deployed for hands-on exercises. 

Currently, VM2 is being protected by RSV1 (Recovery Services Vault 1) with daily backup policies configured for student demonstrations. However, due to organizational restructuring of their training resources and to better align with real-world enterprise scenarios, MDFT Pro needs to consolidate their backup management. They want to migrate VM2's backup protection from RSV1 to RSV2 (Recovery Services Vault 2) to centralize backup operations and simplify vault management for their training programs. 

This migration scenario will help students understand proper procedures for reorganizing backup infrastructure in enterprise environments while maintaining data protection and compliance requirements.

Mark needs to demonstrate to his students the first step required to migrate VM2's backup protection from RSV1 to RSV2.

What should be done first to use RSV2 to protect VM2 instead of RSV1?
