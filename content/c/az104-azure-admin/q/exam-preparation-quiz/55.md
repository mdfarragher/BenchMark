title: "Virtual Machine Scale Set Autoscaling Behavior During High CPU Utilization"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
  - id: "answer1"
    title: "2 virtual machines"
    correct: false
    explain: "This would be below the minimum threshold. The scale set currently has 4 instances and with high CPU utilization, autoscaling will trigger scale-out operations, not scale-in."
  - id: "answer2"
    title: "4 virtual machines"
    correct: false
    explain: "The scale set starts with 4 VMs, but with 85% CPU utilization (above the 80% threshold) sustained for 6 minutes, autoscaling will trigger scale-out to add more instances."
  - id: "answer3"
    title: "6 virtual machines"
    correct: true
    explain: "With 85% CPU utilization exceeding the 80% scale-out threshold, autoscaling will add 2 VMs (as configured) to the current 4 VMs, resulting in 6 total virtual machines running."
  - id: "answer4"
    title: "10 virtual machines"
    correct: false
    explain: "This would require multiple scale-out events. A single scale-out operation adds only 2 VMs as configured, taking the count from 4 to 6 VMs, not 10."
  - id: "answer5"
    title: "20 virtual machines"
    correct: false
    explain: "20 VMs is the maximum configured limit, but a single scale-out event will only add 2 VMs. Multiple sustained high-utilization periods would be needed to reach the maximum."

Mark works as the Cloud Architecture Instructor at MDFT Pro, an Azure training organization specializing in scalable infrastructure solutions. He's conducting an advanced workshop on Virtual Machine Scale Sets for their AZ-104 Azure Administrator certification program. MDFT Pro has deployed Scale1, a virtual machine scale set, as part of their hands-on training environment to demonstrate autoscaling concepts to students. 

Claire, the Performance Monitoring Specialist, has configured Scale1 with specific autoscaling rules to simulate real-world application scaling scenarios. The scale set is designed to handle variable workloads typical of modern web applications, where traffic patterns can fluctuate significantly throughout the day. During a practical exercise, students are observing the autoscaling behavior as the training application experiences sustained high CPU utilization of 85% for six minutes, which exceeds the configured scale-out threshold. 

This scenario helps students understand how Azure automatically responds to performance metrics and adjusts compute capacity to maintain application performance while optimizing costs.

Scale1 is configured with the following settings:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|--------|
| **Instance Configuration** | |
| Instance count | 4 |
| Instance size | DS1_v2 |
| Deploy as low priority | No |
| Use managed disks | Yes |
| **Autoscale Configuration** | |
| Autoscale | Enabled |
| Minimum number of VMs | 2 |
| Maximum number of VMs | 20 |
| **Scale Out Rules** | |
| CPU threshold | 80% |
| Number of VMs to increase by | 2 |
| **Scale In Rules** | |
| CPU threshold | 30% |
| Number of VMs to decrease by | 4 |

If Scale1 is utilized at 85% CPU for six minutes, how many virtual machines will Scale1 be running?
