title: "Virtual Machine Scale Set Auto Scaling Configuration"

    title: "2 virtual machines"
    correct: true
    explain: "When CPU utilization drops to 25% (below the scale-in threshold of 30%), the scale set will scale down by 4 VMs from the initial 4, but it cannot go below the minimum of 2 VMs. When CPU increases to 50% (below the scale-out threshold of 80%), no scale-out occurs, so it remains at 2 VMs."

    title: "4 virtual machines"
    correct: false
    explain: "This would only be correct if no scaling occurred, but since the CPU dropped to 25% (below the 30% scale-in threshold), scaling would occur to reduce the VM count."
  - id: "answer3"
    title: "6 virtual machines"
    correct: false
    explain: "This count would require a scale-out event, but 50% CPU utilization is below the 80% threshold needed to trigger scaling out, so no additional VMs would be added."
  - id: "answer4"
    title: "10 virtual machines"
    correct: false
    explain: "This would require significant scale-out activity, but neither 25% nor 50% CPU utilization reaches the 80% threshold required to trigger scale-out operations."
  - id: "answer5"
    title: "20 virtual machines"
    correct: false
    explain: "This is the maximum VM limit, but would only be reached through multiple scale-out events triggered by sustained high CPU usage above 80%, which doesn't occur in this scenario."

Mark works as a Cloud Infrastructure Manager at MDFT Pro, a technology training agency that provides Azure certification courses to students across multiple regions. Claire, the DevOps Training Coordinator, has been tasked with setting up scalable virtual infrastructure to support their growing student lab environments. As part of their Azure infrastructure optimization project, they need to implement virtual machine scale sets that can automatically adjust to varying student workloads throughout different training sessions and peak learning periods.

Mark has created a virtual machine scale set named Scale1 to host the training lab environments. The scale set configuration needs to handle the fluctuating demands as students connect and disconnect from lab sessions throughout the day. The current configuration shows specific autoscaling rules that will determine how many virtual machines run based on CPU utilization patterns.

| Configuration | Value |
|---------------|--------|
| **Instance Count** | 4 |
| **Instance Size** | DS1_v2 |
| **Deploy as Low Priority** | No |
| **Use Managed Disks** | Yes |

| Autoscale Settings | Value |
|-------------------|--------|
| **Autoscale** | Enabled |
| **Minimum VMs** | 2 |
| **Maximum VMs** | 20 |

| Scale Out Rules | Value |
|----------------|--------|
| **CPU Threshold** | 80% |
| **VMs to Increase By** | 2 |

| Scale In Rules | Value |
|---------------|--------|
| **CPU Threshold** | 30% |
| **VMs to Decrease By** | 4 |

The training environment experiences variable loads depending on class schedules. During a monitoring period, Scale1 shows 25% CPU utilization for six minutes, followed by 50% CPU utilization for another six minutes.

Based on the autoscaling configuration and these utilization patterns, how many virtual machines will Scale1 be running after this monitoring period?
