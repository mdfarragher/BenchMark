    title: "Create a Storage Sync Service"
    correct: true
    explain: "The Storage Sync Service is the top-level Azure resource for Azure File Sync and must be created first. It serves as the management point for all sync relationships and contains sync groups."
  - id: "answer2"
    title: "Create a Sync Group"
    correct: true
    explain: "A Sync Group must be created after the Storage Sync Service. It defines the sync topology and contains the Azure file share (cloud endpoint) and server endpoints that will stay in sync."

    title: "Install the Azure File Sync Agent"
    correct: false
    explain: "The Azure File Sync agent is installed on the on-premises server (Server1), not as part of the Azure subscription preparation. This is a server-side operation performed later."
  - id: "answer4"
    title: "Run Server registration"
    correct: false
    explain: "Server registration is performed on the on-premises server after installing the agent, not as part of the Azure subscription preparation steps. This establishes trust between the server and Storage Sync Service."

Mark works as the Storage Solutions Architect at MDFT Pro, a technology training agency that provides hands-on Azure certification courses to students worldwide. Claire, the IT Infrastructure Manager, has been tasked with implementing a hybrid file synchronization solution to ensure that training materials and course resources are consistently available both in their on-premises training centers and in Azure cloud storage. Their goal is to create a seamless file sharing experience for instructors and students across multiple locations.

The agency has an Azure subscription that contains an Azure file share which will serve as the central repository for all training materials. They also have an on-premises server named Server1 running Windows Server 2016 located in their main training facility. This server currently hosts critical course materials, virtual machine templates, and documentation that instructors need to access locally for optimal performance during hands-on lab sessions.

Mark needs to prepare the Azure subscription to support Azure File Sync between Server1 and the existing Azure file share. The implementation must ensure that changes made to files in either location are synchronized automatically, providing instructors with up-to-date materials regardless of whether they're working on-premises or in the cloud. The solution should also support the agency's planned expansion to additional training centers in different regions.

To properly prepare the Azure subscription for the planned Azure File Sync implementation, which two actions should Mark perform in the correct order?
