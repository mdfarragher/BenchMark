Mark serves as the Cloud Storage Engineer at MDFT Pro, a technology training agency that provides comprehensive Azure certification programs to thousands of students globally. Claire, the Data Management Specialist, has been assigned to optimize the agency's cloud storage costs while ensuring they have the flexibility to store different types of training content with varying access patterns. The organization needs to store course videos, documentation, archived student projects, and frequently accessed lab materials efficiently.

MDFT Pro requires a storage solution that can accommodate their diverse content lifecycle management needs. Course videos and current materials need to be readily available (hot storage), while older course versions can be moved to less expensive storage tiers (cool storage). Additionally, completed student projects and historical course materials that are rarely accessed but must be retained for compliance purposes should be stored in the most cost-effective long-term storage option (archive storage).

The storage account must also provide fault tolerance to ensure that critical training materials remain available even if a disaster affects the primary Azure region where the account resides. This requirement is essential given that MDFT Pro serves students across multiple time zones and cannot afford extended downtime that would disrupt ongoing certification courses.

Mark needs to create an Azure Storage account using the Azure CLI that meets these requirements for cost optimization, access tier flexibility, and disaster recovery capabilities.

```bash
az storage account create -g RG1 -n stor1 --kind __________ --sku Standard_GRS
```

What value should Mark use for the `--kind` parameter to meet all the specified requirements?
