title: "Azure App Service Custom Domain Configuration"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Stop the web app"
      correct: false
      explain: "Stopping the web app is not required for custom domain configuration and would cause unnecessary downtime for students accessing the learning platform. Custom domains can be configured while the app is running."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Upload a certificate"
      correct: false
      explain: "Uploading a certificate is part of the SSL/TLS configuration process, but it comes after domain verification. You must first configure DNS records to prove domain ownership before you can associate certificates with the custom domain."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Add a connection string"
      correct: false
      explain: "Adding a connection string is related to application configuration and database connectivity, which has no relationship to custom domain setup. This step is not part of the domain configuration process."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Create a DNS record"
      correct: true
      explain: "Creating DNS records (both verification TXT record and routing A/CNAME record) is the essential first step to prove domain ownership and enable Azure to route traffic to your app. Without proper DNS configuration, Azure cannot verify you own the domain or direct traffic appropriately."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, operates an Azure web app called LearningHub that provides online course access and certification tracking for students. As the newly hired Azure administrator for MDFT Pro, you need to configure a professional custom domain to enhance the organization's brand presence. 

Mark, the CTO and boss at MDFT Pro, has purchased the domain www.mdftpro.com and wants it to point to the LearningHub web app so that students and trainers can access the platform using the branded URL instead of the default Azure domain.

The LearningHub web app is currently accessible via learninghub.azurewebsites.net, but MDFT Pro wants to provide a more professional experience for their educational services by using their custom domain www.mdftpro.com.

What should you do first to configure the custom domain www.mdftpro.com for the LearningHub web app?
