title: "Azure Storage Account SKU Parameter For Disaster Recovery"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
  - id: "answer1"
    title: "Standard_GRS"
    correct: true
    explain: "Standard_GRS (Geo-Redundant Storage) provides fault tolerance by replicating data to a secondary region hundreds of miles away from the primary region. This meets the disaster recovery requirement at a lower cost than RA-GRS."
  - id: "answer2"
    title: "Standard_LRS"
    correct: false
    explain: "Standard_LRS (Locally Redundant Storage) only replicates data within a single datacenter in the primary region. It doesn't provide protection if a disaster affects the entire Azure region."
  - id: "answer3"
    title: "Standard_RAGRS"
    correct: false
    explain: "While Standard_RA-GRS provides geo-redundancy and read access to the secondary region, it's more expensive than Standard_GRS. Since the scenario only requires fault tolerance (not read access to secondary), GRS is more cost-effective."
  - id: "answer4"
    title: "Premium_LRS"
    correct: false
    explain: "Premium_LRS provides high-performance SSD storage but only replicates locally within one datacenter. It doesn't provide regional disaster recovery and is significantly more expensive than standard storage."

Mark works as the Cloud Storage Engineer at MDFT Pro, a technology training agency that provides comprehensive Azure certification programs to thousands of students globally. Claire, the Data Management Specialist, has been tasked with implementing a cost-effective storage solution that ensures business continuity for the agency's critical training materials. The organization needs to balance cost optimization with robust disaster recovery capabilities to protect against regional outages that could disrupt their global training operations.

MDFT Pro's storage requirements include hosting course videos, documentation, student labs, and other training materials that support their 24/7 global learning platform. The agency has experienced rapid growth and needs to carefully manage storage costs while ensuring that a disaster affecting their primary Azure region won't result in data loss or extended downtime. The storage solution must support multiple access tiers (hot, cool, and archive) to optimize costs based on content access patterns.

The storage account must provide automatic failover capabilities so that if the primary region becomes unavailable due to a natural disaster or major service disruption, the training platform can continue operating with minimal interruption. This requirement is critical because MDFT Pro has students taking certification exams and accessing time-sensitive course materials across different time zones around the clock.

Mark has determined that StorageV2 is the appropriate account kind to support all required access tiers and cost optimization goals. Now he needs to select the appropriate SKU parameter that will provide the necessary fault tolerance for regional disasters while minimizing costs.

```bash
az storage account create -g RG1 -n stor1 --kind StorageV2 --sku __________
```

What value should Mark use for the `--sku` parameter to meet the fault tolerance requirement at the lowest cost?
