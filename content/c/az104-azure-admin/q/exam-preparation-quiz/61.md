title: "Virtual Network Peering Between Azure Government And Public Cloud"
type: "question"

answers:
  - id: "answer1"
    title: "Yes, peering is possible between VNet1 and VNet2"
    correct: false
    explain: "Virtual network peering cannot be established between different Azure cloud types. Azure Government and Public Azure are separate cloud environments with network isolation."
  - id: "answer2"
    title: "No, peering is not possible between VNet1 and VNet2"
    correct: true
    explain: "Correct. VNet1 is in Azure Government and VNet2 is in Public Azure. These are different cloud environments and virtual network peering cannot cross cloud boundaries."
  - id: "answer3"
    title: "Yes, but only with ExpressRoute connectivity"
    correct: false
    explain: "ExpressRoute can connect on-premises networks to different Azure clouds, but it cannot enable VNet peering between Azure Government and Public Azure."
  - id: "answer4"
    title: "Yes, but requires special government approval"
    correct: false
    explain: "No special approval can enable cross-cloud VNet peering. The network isolation between Azure Government and Public Azure is by design and cannot be bridged through peering."

Mark, a senior cloud architect at MDFT Pro training agency, is designing network connectivity for a new Azure certification course. The course will demonstrate hybrid cloud scenarios where students learn to work with different Azure environments. As part of the curriculum, Claire, the lead Azure instructor, needs to show students the limitations and possibilities of connecting virtual networks across different Azure cloud types. The training environment includes virtual networks deployed in Azure Government, Public Azure, and Azure China to provide comprehensive hands-on experience with multi-cloud networking scenarios.

The training setup includes the following virtual networks:

| Name  | Location  | Cloud Type      |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| VNet1 | East US   | Azure Government|
| VNet2 | West US 2 | Public          |
| VNet3 | China East| Azure China     |

Can virtual network peering be established between VNet1 and VNet2?
