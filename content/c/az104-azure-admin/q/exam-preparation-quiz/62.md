  - id: "answer1"
    title: "Yes, peering is possible between VNet1 and VNet3"
    correct: false
    explain: "This is incorrect. Virtual network peering cannot be established between Azure Government and Azure China as these are separate sovereign cloud environments with network isolation boundaries."
  - id: "answer2"
    title: "No, peering is not possible between VNet1 and VNet3"
    correct: true
    explain: "Correct. VNet1 is in Azure Government and VNet3 is in Azure China. These are different sovereign cloud environments and virtual network peering cannot cross sovereign cloud boundaries."
  - id: "answer3"
    title: "Yes, but only through ExpressRoute Global Reach"
    correct: false
    explain: "ExpressRoute Global Reach is used for connecting on-premises networks across different regions, not for virtual network peering between sovereign clouds."
  - id: "answer4"
    title: "No, sovereign clouds cannot peer with each other"
    correct: false
    explain: "This is too broad a statement. Some sovereign cloud peering scenarios are possible depending on the specific cloud environments and compliance requirements."

Mark, the technical curriculum director at MDFT Pro training agency, is developing an advanced Azure networking course focused on sovereign cloud deployments. The course is designed for government contractors and international organizations that need to understand connectivity options across different Azure sovereign environments. Claire, a compliance specialist working under Mark, has been assigned to help create scenarios that demonstrate the complexities of multi-sovereign cloud networking for students preparing for advanced Azure certifications. The training lab environment simulates real-world scenarios where organizations operate across multiple sovereign boundaries.

The training infrastructure includes virtual networks across different Azure cloud environments:

| Name  | Location  | Cloud Type      |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| VNet1 | East US   | Azure Government|
| VNet2 | West US 2 | Public          |
| VNet3 | China East| Azure China     |

Can virtual network peering be established between VNet1 and VNet3?
