Mark, a governance specialist at MDFT Pro training agency, is developing a comprehensive Azure resource management course for enterprise customers. The course focuses on implementing proper resource protection and cost management strategies across large Azure deployments. Claire, a senior instructor, needs to demonstrate the different scopes where protective measures like locks can be applied to prevent accidental resource deletion or modification. The training scenario involves a typical enterprise Azure hierarchy where students learn to implement governance controls at appropriate levels.

The training environment includes the following Azure resource hierarchy:

| Level | Resource Name | Type |
|-------|---------------|------|
| Management Group | MG1 | Management Group |
| Subscription | Sub1 | Subscription |
| Resource Group | RG1 | Resource Group |
| Virtual Machine | VM1 | Virtual Machine |

At which levels can Azure resource locks be applied to prevent resource deletion?
