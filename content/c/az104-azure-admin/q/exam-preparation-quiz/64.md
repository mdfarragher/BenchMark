Claire, the cost management specialist at MDFT Pro training agency, is creating an Azure financial governance course for enterprise finance teams. The course teaches students how to implement effective cost tracking and resource organization strategies using Azure's built-in tools. Mark, the lead technical instructor, has emphasized the importance of demonstrating proper tagging strategies across different organizational levels to help students understand how to implement comprehensive cost allocation and resource tracking. The training environment simulates a multi-department organization where proper resource categorization is essential for accurate billing and resource management.

The training setup includes a typical enterprise Azure resource hierarchy:

| Level | Resource Name | Type |
|-------|---------------|------|
| Management Group | MG1 | Management Group |
| Subscription | Sub1 | Subscription |
| Resource Group | RG1 | Resource Group |
| Virtual Machine | VM1 | Virtual Machine |

At which levels can Azure tags be applied for resource tracking and cost allocation?
