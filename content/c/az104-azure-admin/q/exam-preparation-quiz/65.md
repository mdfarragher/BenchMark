title: "Azure Load Balancer Prerequisites For Load Balancing Rules"
type: "question"
layout: "multiple"
answers:
  - id: "answer1"
    title: "A frontend IP address"
    correct: false
    explain: "A frontend IP address is automatically created with the load balancer and is not an additional resource that needs to be created separately for load balancing rules."
  - id: "answer2"
    title: "A backend pool"
    correct: true
    explain: "Correct. A backend pool is required to define which virtual machines will receive the load-balanced traffic. VM1 and VM2 must be added to this pool."
  - id: "answer3"
    title: "A health probe"
    correct: true
    explain: "Correct. A health probe is essential to monitor the health of the backend virtual machines and ensure traffic is only sent to healthy instances."
  - id: "answer4"
    title: "An inbound NAT rule"
    correct: false
    explain: "Inbound NAT rules are used for port forwarding to specific VMs, not for load balancing traffic across multiple VMs. They are not required for load balancing rules."
  - id: "answer5"
    title: "A virtual network"
    correct: false
    explain: "The virtual network should already exist since VM1 and VM2 are deployed. It's not an additional load balancer resource that needs to be created."

Mark, a senior infrastructure architect at MDFT Pro training agency, is developing an advanced Azure networking course focused on high availability and scalability patterns. The course is designed for students preparing for Azure architect certifications who need deep understanding of load balancing concepts. Claire, the lead networking instructor, is creating hands-on labs where students configure complete load balancing solutions from scratch. The training scenario involves setting up web applications with proper health monitoring and traffic distribution to demonstrate enterprise-grade availability patterns that students will encounter in real-world deployments.

The lab environment consists of an Azure subscription containing two virtual machines (VM1 and VM2) that will host identical web applications. Students have already created an Azure Load Balancer and now need to configure a load balancing rule to distribute HTTPS traffic between the virtual machines.

Which two additional load balancer components must be created before the load balancing rule can be configured?
