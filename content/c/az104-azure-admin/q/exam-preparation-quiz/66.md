answers:
  - id: "answer1"
    title: "Yes"
    correct: true
    explain: "The storage account configuration shows defaultAction: 'Allow' in the networkAcls section with empty IP rules and virtual network rules, which means all public IP addresses including 131.107.103.10 can access the storage account."
  - id: "answer2" 
    title: "No"
    correct: false
    explain: "This is incorrect because the network access control list (ACL) is configured to allow all traffic by default, so the server with IP 131.107.103.10 would have access."

Mark is the Cloud Infrastructure Trainer at MDFT Pro educational services, and he's preparing a hands-on lab session for Claire, who serves as the Senior Systems Administrator trainee in their Azure certification program. During today's lesson on Azure Storage security, Mark has configured a storage account named storageaccount1 to demonstrate network access control policies. The storage account was deployed using an ARM template that includes specific network access control list (networkAcls) settings. Claire needs to understand how the current configuration affects access from external servers, particularly from a server with public IP address 131.107.103.10 that the training agency uses for testing connectivity to Azure resources.

The ARM template shows the following configuration for storageaccount1:

```json
{
  "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts",
  "apiVersion": "2019-06-01",
  "name": "storageaccount1",
  "location": "eastus",
  "sku": {
    "name": "Standard_LRS",
    "tier": "Standard"
  },
  "kind": "StorageV2",
  "properties": {
    "networkAcls": {
      "bypass": "AzureServices",
      "virtualNetworkRules": [],
      "ipRules": [],
      "defaultAction": "Allow"
    },
    "supportsHttpsTrafficOnly": true,
    "encryption": {
      "services": {
        "file": {
          "keyType": "Account",
          "enabled": true
        },
        "blob": {
          "keyType": "Account",
          "enabled": true
        }
      },
      "keySource": "Microsoft.Storage"
    },
    "accessTier": "Hot"
  }
}
```

Can a server that has a public IP address of 131.107.103.10 access storageaccount1?
