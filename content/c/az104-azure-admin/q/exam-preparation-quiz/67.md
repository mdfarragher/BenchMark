    title: "Yes"
    correct: true
    explain: "Individual blobs in a StorageV2 account can be moved to the archive tier regardless of the account-level access tier setting. The account shows 'accessTier': 'Hot' but this only sets the default tier for new blobs, not a restriction on blob-level tier changes."
  - id: "answer2"
    title: "No"
    correct: false
    explain: "This is incorrect because StorageV2 accounts support all blob access tiers (Hot, Cool, Archive) at the individual blob level, even when the account default access tier is set to Hot."

Mark is conducting a data lifecycle management workshop for Claire, the Storage Solutions Architect trainee at MDFT Pro training academy. During their session on Azure Blob Storage optimization strategies, they're examining a storage account named storageaccount1 that was previously deployed for their cloud storage certification course. Claire needs to understand the relationship between account-level access tier settings and individual blob tier management capabilities. The training scenario involves determining whether individual blobs can be moved to the archive tier for long-term, cost-effective storage of infrequently accessed training materials and student project archives.

The ARM template configuration shows the following settings for storageaccount1:

```json
{
  "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts",
  "apiVersion": "2019-06-01",
  "name": "storageaccount1",
  "location": "eastus",
  "sku": {
    "name": "Standard_LRS",
    "tier": "Standard"
  },
  "kind": "StorageV2",
  "properties": {
    "networkAcls": {
      "bypass": "AzureServices",
      "virtualNetworkRules": [],
      "ipRules": [],
      "defaultAction": "Allow"
    },
    "supportsHttpsTrafficOnly": true,
    "encryption": {
      "services": {
        "file": {
          "keyType": "Account",
          "enabled": true
        },
        "blob": {
          "keyType": "Account",
          "enabled": true
        }
      },
      "keySource": "Microsoft.Storage"
    },
    "accessTier": "Hot"
  }
}
```

Can individual blobs in storageaccount1 be set to use the archive tier?
