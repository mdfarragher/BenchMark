layout: "single"
answers:
  - id: "answer1"
    title: "vm1.core.windows.net"
    correct: false
    explain: "This is not the correct internal DNS format for Azure VMs. The core.windows.net domain is not used for internal VM DNS resolution within virtual networks."
  - id: "answer2"
    title: "vm1.azure.com"
    correct: false
    explain: "Azure.com is not the domain used for internal DNS resolution within Azure virtual networks. This would not be returned in a reverse DNS lookup for internal VM communication."
  - id: "answer3"
    title: "vm1.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com"
    correct: false
    explain: "This format is used for public DNS names when VMs have public IP addresses, not for internal DNS resolution between VMs in the same virtual network."
  - id: "answer4"
    title: "vm1.internal.cloudapp.net"
    correct: true
    explain: "Azure VMs use the internal.cloudapp.net domain for internal DNS resolution within virtual networks. When performing reverse DNS lookups for internal IP addresses, the FQDN follows the pattern vmname.internal.cloudapp.net."

Mark is conducting a networking fundamentals workshop for Claire, who works as a Network Solutions Architect trainee at MDFT Pro training center. During their Azure networking certification course, they're exploring DNS resolution mechanisms within Azure virtual networks. Mark has set up a lab environment with two Windows Server 2019 virtual machines in the West Europe region to demonstrate internal DNS resolution patterns. 

Claire needs to understand how reverse DNS lookups work when Azure VMs communicate with each other using the default Azure-provided DNS service, which is essential for troubleshooting connectivity issues and understanding Azure's internal naming conventions.

The virtual machine configuration shows:

| Name | Operating System | Location | IP Address | DNS Server |
|------|------------------|----------|------------|------------|
| VM1  | Windows Server 2019 | West Europe | 10.0.0.4 | Default (Azure-provided) |
| VM2  | Windows Server 2019 | West Europe | 10.0.0.5 | Default (Azure-provided) |

When you perform a reverse DNS lookup for 10.0.0.4 from VM2, which FQDN will be returned?
