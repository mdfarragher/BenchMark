MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, operates a diverse set of virtual machines in Azure to support their educational infrastructure. As the newly hired backup administrator for MDFT Pro, you need to implement a comprehensive backup strategy to protect the training environment. 

Mark, the CTO and boss at MDFT Pro, wants to ensure all critical systems are backed up nightly at 23:00 using Azure Backup and a Recovery Services vault called TrainingVault. The training environment consists of virtual machines running different operating systems to support various courses and learning scenarios:

| Name | Operating System | Auto-shutdown |
|------|------------------|---------------|
| TrainingVM1 | Windows Server 2012 R2 | Off |
| TrainingVM2 | Windows Server 2016 | 19:00 |
| TrainingVM3 | Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS | Off |
| TrainingVM4 | Windows 10 | 19:00 |

You need to determine which virtual machines can be included in the backup schedule, considering that auto-shutdown settings should not affect backup capability since backups occur at 23:00.

Which virtual machines can you back up by using Azure Backup?
