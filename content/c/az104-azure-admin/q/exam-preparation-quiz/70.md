    title: "New-AzVm"
    correct: false
    explain: "New-AzVm is used to create virtual machines directly with specified parameters, not for deploying ARM templates. This cmdlet doesn't support the -TemplateUri parameter."
  - id: "answer2"
    title: "New-AzResource"
    correct: false
    explain: "New-AzResource is used to create individual Azure resources, but it's not designed for deploying complete ARM templates. It doesn't support template-based deployments with -TemplateUri."
  - id: "answer3"
    title: "New-AzTemplateSpec"
    correct: false
    explain: "New-AzTemplateSpec is used to create template specifications for storing and versioning ARM templates, not for deploying them. This cmdlet manages template storage rather than deployment."
  - id: "answer4"
    title: "New-AzResourceGroupDeployment"
    correct: true
    explain: "New-AzResourceGroupDeployment is the correct cmdlet for deploying ARM templates to a resource group. It supports the -TemplateUri parameter to deploy templates from URLs and accepts template parameters like adminUsername and adminPassword."

Mark is leading an Infrastructure as Code workshop for Claire, who serves as the DevOps Solutions Architect trainee at MDFT Pro educational services. During their Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template certification training, they're working in Azure Cloud Shell to deploy virtual machine infrastructure using declarative templates. Mark has prepared a PowerShell script that will deploy a VM using an ARM template hosted at a specific URI, but Claire needs to identify the correct PowerShell cmdlet to complete the deployment command. The scenario demonstrates best practices for automated infrastructure deployment and parameter passing for secure credential handling.

The following resources are available in their training environment:

| Name | Type | Details |
|------|------|---------|
| ManagementGroup1 | Management group | Organizational structure |
| RG1 | Resource group | Target deployment location |
| 9c8bc1cd-7655-4c66-b3ea-a8ee101d8f75 | Subscription ID | Active subscription |
| Tag1 | Tag | Resource labeling |

In Azure Cloud Shell, you need to create a virtual machine by using an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template. The PowerShell command structure is:

```powershell
$adminPassword = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter the administrator password" -AsSecureString
New-__________
    -TemplateUri "https://mdftpro.com/templates/...."
    -adminUsername admin
    -adminPassword $adminPassword
    __________ 
    -dnsLabelPrefix ContosoVM1 
```

How should you complete the "New-" command?
