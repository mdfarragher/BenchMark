layout: "single"
answers:
  - id: "answer1"
    title: "-Tag Tag1"
    correct: false
    explain: "Tags are used for resource organization and billing but are not required parameters for VM deployment. Tags can be specified but won't complete the basic deployment command structure."
  - id: "answer2"
    title: "-ResourceGroupName RG1"
    correct: true
    explain: "The ResourceGroupName parameter is required when deploying ARM templates as it specifies the target resource group where the VM will be created. This is a mandatory parameter for the New-AzResourceGroupDeployment cmdlet."
  - id: "answer3"
    title: "-GroupName ManagementGroup1"
    correct: false
    explain: "GroupName is not a valid parameter for ARM template deployments. Management groups are used for organizing subscriptions and applying governance policies, not for resource deployments."
  - id: "answer4"
    title: "-Subscription 9c8bc1cd-7655-4c66-b3ea-a8ee101d8f75"
    correct: false
    explain: "While subscription context is important, the Subscription parameter is not required when the context is already set. The ResourceGroupName parameter is more critical for specifying the deployment target."

Mark is the lead Azure trainer at MDFT Pro training agency, working with Claire, a senior cloud architect. They are conducting an advanced Azure Resource Manager workshop for a group of IT professionals preparing for the AZ-104 certification. During the hands-on lab session, students need to deploy virtual machines using ARM templates through Azure Cloud Shell. Mark has prepared a scenario where students must complete a PowerShell command that deploys a VM using a pre-built ARM template. The template requires specific parameters including administrative credentials and resource targeting information. Students have access to a subscription containing ManagementGroup1, resource group RG1, subscription ID 9c8bc1cd-7655-4c66-b3ea-a8ee101d8f75, and Tag1 for resource organization.

The following table shows the available Azure resources:

| Name | Type |
|------|------|
| ManagementGroup1 | Management group |
| RG1 | Resource group |
| 9c8bc1cd-7655-4c66-b3ea-a8ee101d8f75 | Subscription ID |
| Tag1 | Tag |

Students need to complete this PowerShell command in Azure Cloud Shell:

```powershell
$adminPassword = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter the administrator password" -AsSecureString
New-AzResourceGroupDeployment
    -TemplateUri "https://mdftpro.com/templates/...."
    -adminUsername admin
    -adminPassword $adminPassword
    __________
    -dnsLabelPrefix ContosoVM1
```

Which parameter should complete the command to properly target the resource deployment?
