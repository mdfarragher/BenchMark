Mark is a cloud solutions trainer at MDFT Pro training agency, working with Claire, a senior application developer, to deliver an Azure App Service workshop for web developers. During their practical exercise session, students are troubleshooting a production issue with a web application called App1 that was initially deployed to save costs. The application is hosted in Plan1, an App Service plan configured with the Free pricing tier to minimize expenses during development. However, the development team has reported that App1 automatically stops running after 60 minutes of continuous operation each day, causing service interruptions and affecting user experience. This behavior is preventing proper testing and evaluation of the application's performance under sustained load. Students need to understand the limitations of different App Service pricing tiers and determine whether upgrading to Basic tier will resolve the runtime limitation issue.

Does changing the pricing tier of Plan1 from Free to Basic meet the goal of ensuring App1 can run continuously for the entire day?
