Mark, the Azure security architect at MDFT Pro training agency, is collaborating with Claire, an identity and access management specialist trainee, to design a comprehensive RBAC workshop for IT administrators. During their hands-on exercise, students are working with an Azure Active Directory tenant named Adatum and an Azure subscription containing a development resource group called RG-DEV. 

The training scenario involves a development team organized under a security group called "Developers" who need specific permissions to create and deploy Azure Logic Apps for workflow automation projects. The goal is to implement the principle of least privilege by granting only the necessary permissions for Logic App creation within the designated development resource group, without providing broader access to other Azure services or resource groups. 

Students must determine whether assigning the Logic App Contributor role to the Developers group on the RG-DEV resource group meets the security and functional requirements.

Does assigning the Logic App Contributor role to the Developers group on RG-DEV meet the goal of enabling Logic App creation in that resource group?
