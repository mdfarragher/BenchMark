title: "Configure Azure Function App For Dynamic Resource Allocation And Execution-Based Billing"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
  - id: "answer1"
    title: "The Windows operating system and the Consumption plan hosting plan"
    correct: true
    explain: "The Consumption plan provides automatic dynamic resource allocation and scales to zero when idle. Billing is based purely on execution time and resource consumption, making it perfect for event-driven workloads like Event Grid integration."
  - id: "answer2"
    title: "The Windows operating system and the App Service plan hosting plan"
    correct: false
    explain: "App Service plan uses fixed pricing based on allocated compute capacity, not execution-based billing. Resources are pre-allocated rather than dynamically allocated, which doesn't meet the requirement for execution-based billing."
  - id: "answer3"
    title: "The Docker container and an App Service plan that uses the B1 pricing tier"
    correct: false
    explain: "B1 App Service plan has fixed monthly pricing regardless of execution frequency. Docker containers add overhead and complexity but don't provide the dynamic resource allocation and execution-based billing model required."
  - id: "answer4"
    title: "The Docker container and an App Service plan that uses the S1 pricing tier"
    correct: false
    explain: "S1 App Service plan also uses fixed pricing model rather than execution-based billing. The tier provides more resources than B1 but still doesn't offer dynamic allocation or pay-per-execution billing."

Mark is a senior serverless solutions architect at MDFT Pro training agency, working with Claire, the cloud integration specialist, to deliver an advanced Azure Functions workshop for developers. They are designing a practical lab where students build event-driven applications that connect to Azure Event Grid for real-time data processing. 

The scenario requires creating a Function App that can handle variable workloads efficiently, with resources automatically scaling up during high-traffic periods and scaling down to zero during idle times to minimize costs. The billing model must be based on actual function executions rather than pre-allocated infrastructure, ensuring cost-effectiveness for event-driven scenarios. 

Students need to understand the different hosting plan options and their billing models to select the configuration that provides true serverless capabilities with dynamic resource allocation and execution-based pricing.

What configuration should be selected when creating the Function App to meet the requirements for dynamic resource allocation and execution-based billing?
