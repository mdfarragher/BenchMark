      title: "Service"
      correct: false
      explain: "Service-level access provides permissions to storage service operations but doesn't specifically target individual blob objects. This would be too broad for downloading specific course materials by name."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Container"
      correct: false
      explain: "Container-level access provides permissions to container operations and blob listings but doesn't provide the granular object-level access needed to download specific course materials by their individual names."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Object"
      correct: true
      explain: "Object-level resource type grants access to individual blobs within containers, allowing students to download specific course materials by name. This provides the precise granular access needed while maintaining security by limiting access to specific objects rather than entire containers."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Account"
      correct: false
      explain: "Account-level access provides broad permissions across all storage services and would be excessive for the requirement of downloading specific course materials. This violates the principle of least privilege access."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, operates an Azure storage account called CourseStorage that contains educational materials including course documents, training videos, and certification resources. As the newly hired storage administrator for MDFT Pro, you need to configure secure access for students to download specific course materials. 

Mark, the CTO and boss at MDFT Pro, wants to implement a solution where students can securely download individual course files by name without having broader access to browse or list all available content in the storage containers.

The CourseStorage account contains multiple containers with sensitive training materials, and MDFT Pro requires a security model where students can only access specific course materials they are authorized for, rather than having general access to browse through all available educational content.

Which SAS resource type setting should you configure to ensure students can only download specific course materials securely by name?
