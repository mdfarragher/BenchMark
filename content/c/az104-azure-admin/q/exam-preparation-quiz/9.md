type: "question"
layout: "multiple"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Read"
      correct: true
      explain: "Read permission allows students to download and access course materials from the storage account. This is the appropriate permission for downloading specific course files by name, providing exactly the access needed without granting unnecessary privileges."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Write"
      correct: false
      explain: "Write permission allows modification of existing blobs, which is not necessary for students who only need to download course materials. This would provide more access than required for the use case."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Delete"
      correct: false
      explain: "Delete permission allows removal of blobs from storage, which is inappropriate for students accessing course materials. This would create security risks by allowing students to remove educational content."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "List"
      correct: false
      explain: "List permission allows browsing and listing contents of containers, which contradicts the requirement to access specific materials by name only. This would allow students to see all available content rather than accessing targeted resources."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "Add"
      correct: false
      explain: "Add permission is specific to append blobs and allows adding data to existing append blobs. This is not applicable for downloading course materials and would provide unnecessary write capabilities."
    - id: "answer6"
      title: "Create"
      correct: false
      explain: "Create permission allows creation of new blobs, which is not needed for students downloading course materials. This would provide unnecessary write capabilities that exceed the security requirements."
    - id: "answer7"
      title: "Update"
      correct: false
      explain: "Update permission allows modification of blob properties and metadata, which is not required for downloading course materials. This would provide administrative-level access that exceeds student needs."
    - id: "answer8"
      title: "Process"
      correct: false
      explain: "Process permission is specific to certain storage operations and is not applicable to the basic requirement of downloading course materials by name."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, operates an Azure storage account called CourseStorage that contains educational materials including course documents, training videos, and certification resources. As the newly hired storage administrator for MDFT Pro, you need to configure appropriate permissions for students to access their course materials. 

Mark, the CTO and boss at MDFT Pro, wants to ensure that students have the minimum necessary permissions to download specific course materials by name while maintaining a secure environment that prevents unauthorized modifications or deletions.

The CourseStorage account contains sensitive training materials and intellectual property that must be protected from accidental or intentional modification. Students should only be able to download the specific course materials they are authorized to access, without the ability to modify, delete, or browse through other content.

Which SAS permission should you configure to allow students to download specific course materials securely by name?
