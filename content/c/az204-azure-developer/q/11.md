title: "Implement Publish-Subscribe Messaging Pattern"
type: "question"
layout: "multiple"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Service Bus"
      correct: true
      explain: "Azure Service Bus supports a publish-subscribe messaging pattern through topics and subscriptions. When integrated with Event Grid, it can deliver events using a push model, eliminating the need for receivers to continuously poll for messages. This reactive programming approach is efficient for low-volume message scenarios."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Event Hub"
      correct: false
      explain: "Azure Event Hubs is designed for high-throughput event streaming and uses a pull-based consumption model where consumers poll for events. While excellent for big data scenarios with millions of events per second, it doesn't eliminate polling and isn't primarily a publish-subscribe system."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Event Grid"
      correct: true
      explain: "Azure Event Grid is specifically designed for event-driven architectures with a publish-subscribe model. It uses push delivery to send events to subscribers (webhooks or Azure services), completely eliminating the need for constant polling. Event Grid simplifies event consumption and reduces costs."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Queue"
      correct: false
      explain: "Azure Storage Queues use a point-to-point messaging pattern, not publish-subscribe. Consumers must continuously poll the queue to check for new messages, which doesn't eliminate polling. Additionally, each message is processed by only one consumer, unlike the broadcast nature of publish-subscribe."

You work as a Solutions Architect for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that delivers certification courses to students worldwide. Mark, the Integration Lead, has asked you to develop a notification system for the learning platform. 

When important events occur, like new course enrollments, certificate completions, or trainer announcements, multiple systems need to be notified simultaneously: the student mobile app needs to send push notifications, the email service needs to send confirmation emails, the analytics system needs to log events for reporting, and the billing system needs to process payments. 

The current solution uses Azure Storage Queues, but the constant polling by multiple consumer services is consuming resources and increasing costs. You need to implement a messaging solution that uses a publish-subscribe pattern where events are pushed to subscribers automatically without requiring them to continuously poll for new messages.

What are two Azure messaging services that can achieve this goal?
