title: "Deploy Microservice Updates Without Downtime"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Enable single revision mode"
      correct: false
      explain: "Single revision mode automatically deactivates the previous revision once the new one is ready, which creates a significant risk: if the new deployment contains bugs in new features or patches, the entire application would go down immediately with no ability to quickly rollback. Without the ability to maintain multiple active revisions and split traffic between them, you cannot perform gradual rollouts, A/B testing, or instant rollbacks when issues are discovered in production."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Use a single environment for all containers"
      correct: false
      explain: "Using a single environment doesn't address the requirement for zero-downtime deployments. Container Apps environments provide the infrastructure for containers, but the revision mode setting determines how updates are deployed. A single environment can host multiple revisions when properly configured."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Use multiple environments for each container"
      correct: false
      explain: "Creating separate environments for each container adds unnecessary complexity and management overhead. Azure Container Apps is designed to handle multiple revisions within a single environment, making multiple environments redundant for zero-downtime updates."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Use a private container registry and single image for all containers"
      correct: false
      explain: "While using a private registry is a security best practice, it doesn't affect how updates are deployed. Using a single image for all containers would actually prevent zero-downtime deployments because you couldn't gradually transition from the old version to the new version."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "Enable multiple revision mode"
      correct: true
      explain: "Multiple revision mode allows you to run several revisions simultaneously and control traffic distribution between them. When you deploy an update, the new revision starts alongside the existing one, and traffic can be switched after the new revision passes health checks. This enables zero-downtime deployments, gradual traffic shifting, and easy rollbacks."

You work as a Microservices Developer for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that delivers cloud certification courses to students worldwide. Mark, the DevOps Lead, has tasked you with developing a Student Assessment Microservice that runs on **Azure Container Apps**. 

The microservice handles quiz submissions, automatic grading, and certificate generation for students completing their courses. External HTTP ingress traffic has been enabled to allow students and trainers to access the service from the web and mobile applications. Due to the critical nature of assessments, any downtime during deployments could disrupt exams in progress and impact the student experience. 

You need to ensure that when deploying updates to fix bugs, add features, or improve performance, the service remains available to all users without interruption.

What should you do to deploy updates to the microservice without causing downtime?
