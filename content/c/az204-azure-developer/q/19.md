title: "Understand API Management URI Rewriting"

      title: "Yes, GET requests will be redirected to http://mdftpro.com/api/9.1/put"
      correct: false
      explain: "While the rewrite-uri policy changes the path to '/put' and set-backend-service changes the base URL, HTTP GET requests typically should not have large request bodies. The policy evaluates the Content-Length header, and most API clients don't send bodies with GET requests, so this condition would rarely be met for GET requests in practice."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "No, the redirect URL will be http://mdftpro.com/api/9.1/get preserving the method"
      correct: false
      explain: "The rewrite-uri template explicitly specifies '/put' as the new path. The policy doesn't dynamically adjust the URI based on the HTTP method—it uses the literal template value provided. The path becomes '/put' regardless of whether the request method is GET, POST, or any other verb."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Yes, but the HTTP method will be changed from GET to PUT"
      correct: false
      explain: "The rewrite-uri policy only changes the URI path component, not the HTTP method. Unless a set-method policy is explicitly added, the original HTTP verb is preserved. A GET request with the path '/put' is still a GET request, just with a different path."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "No, only the path changes to '/put', the full URL construction depends on the base URL"
      correct: true
      explain: "The policy combines the base-url from set-backend-service ('http://mdftpro.com/api/9.1/') with the path template from rewrite-uri ('/put'), resulting in 'http://mdftpro.com/api/9.1/put'. The rewrite-uri template doesn't include the base URL—it only specifies the path portion that gets appended to the backend service base URL."

You work as an API Gateway Administrator for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that provides professional certification courses globally. Claire, the Integration Architect, has configured an Azure API Management policy for the Student Assignment Submission API. The policy examines the Content-Length header to route requests appropriately. When students submit assignments with large attachments (body size > 512KB), such as project portfolios or video presentations, the policy applies two transformations: it uses rewrite-uri with template="/put" to change the request path, and uses set-backend-service with base-url="http://mdftpro.com/api/9.1/" to point to a backend optimized for large file handling. A developer has questioned whether a GET request with a body size larger than 512KB would be redirected to the URL "http://mdftpro.com/api/9.1/put", and how the URI rewriting and backend service configuration work together to construct the final destination URL.

What is the correct behavior when these two policies are applied to a request meeting the size condition?
