title: "Configure Application Insights SDK Source URL"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "URL to download the SDK from"
      correct: true
      explain: "The src key in the script element specifies the URL to download the Application Insights JavaScript SDK file. This typically points to a CDN location like 'https://js.monitor.azure.com/scripts/b/ai.3.gbl.min.js' that hosts the SDK code which will be loaded into the browser to enable telemetry collection."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Application Insights connection string"
      correct: false
      explain: "The connection string is configured in the cfg object, not in the src attribute. The src attribute specifies where to load the SDK code from, while the connection string is a configuration parameter that tells the SDK where to send the collected telemetry data."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "appId used to correlate AJAX dependencies on the client-side with the server-side requests"
      correct: false
      explain: "The appId is used for correlation purposes but is part of the SDK configuration, not the src attribute. The src attribute must contain a URL pointing to the physical JavaScript file that contains the SDK code, not an identifier."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "crossOrigin attribute designating support for cross-origin resource sharing"
      correct: false
      explain: "The crossOrigin attribute is a separate attribute on the script element (typically set to 'anonymous'), not the value of the src attribute. The src attribute must be a valid URL to the SDK JavaScript file, not a CORS configuration setting."

You work as a Frontend Developer for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that delivers certification courses to students worldwide. Mark, the Client Experience Manager, has asked you to implement Real User Monitoring (RUM) using Application Insights to track how students interact with the Learning Portal web application. The portal consists of multiple pages including the course catalog, student dashboard, quiz interface, video player, and certificate download page. You need to monitor page load times, user navigation patterns, JavaScript errors, and AJAX call performance across all these pages. To implement this, you must add the Application Insights JavaScript SDK script element to each page of the portal. The script element has several key properties that need to be configured correctly, including the src key which specifies where the browser should load the SDK code from, and the cfg object which contains the Application Insights configuration settings.

What should you set for the value of the src key in the script element of each page?
