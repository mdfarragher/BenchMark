title: "Select Hosting Plan for Windows Function App"

    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Shared"
      correct: false
      explain: "Azure Functions cannot run on Shared hosting plans. Shared plans are designed for basic web apps and don't provide the infrastructure needed for Azure Functions, including event-driven scaling, long-running execution support, or the necessary runtime environment."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Consumption"
      correct: false
      explain: "The Consumption plan has a maximum timeout of 10 minutes, which is insufficient for requests that can take up to 10 minutes to complete. Additionally, while it provides event-driven autoscaling, the upper scaling limit (200 instances) is less than the Premium plan's maximum."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Premium"
      correct: true
      explain: "The Premium plan supports unbounded execution duration (with platform managed shutdowns after 10 minutes grace period), provides event-driven autoscaling through KEDA, and offers the highest upper scaling limit (up to 100 instances, with potential for more). It supports both Windows code deployments and can handle the 1-10 minute request processing requirement."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Dedicated"
      correct: false
      explain: "While Dedicated (App Service) plans support long-running functions and custom timeout configurations, they don't provide true event-driven autoscaling like the Premium plan. Dedicated plans use manual or scheduled scaling, which doesn't meet the event-driven autoscaling requirement. The upper scaling limit is also constrained by the App Service plan tier."

You work as a Serverless Architecture Designer for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that delivers certification courses to students globally. Mark, the Cloud Operations Director, has asked you to design two Azure Function apps to process student assessment data. App1 is Windows-based and will be deployed as compiled C# code to handle exam grading and score calculations. App2 is Linux-based and will be deployed as a custom container image to run specialized plagiarism detection algorithms. Performance analysis shows that both apps will process requests that take between 1 and 10 minutes to complete, depending on the complexity of the assessment and the number of submissions being processed. The solution must support these long-running operations without timing out, provide event-driven autoscaling so that resources scale up during peak exam periods (when hundreds of students submit simultaneously) and scale down during quiet periods, and maximize the upper scaling limit to handle the largest possible number of concurrent student submissions during final exam seasons.

Which hosting plan should you choose for App1 (the Windows-based code deployment)?
