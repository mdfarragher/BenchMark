title: "Configure Application Insights for Autoscaling"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "An Application Insights metric"
      correct: true
      explain: "Metrics are numerical measurements collected over time that can be used to trigger autoscaling rules. They provide aggregated data like request counts, response times, or custom performance counters that make them ideal for monitoring workload and triggering automatic scaling decisions."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "An Application Insights trace"
      correct: false
      explain: "Traces are diagnostic logging messages used for debugging and understanding application flow. They contain textual information and are not suitable for triggering autoscaling because they don't provide numerical measurements that can be evaluated against thresholds."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "An Application Insights dependency"
      correct: false
      explain: "Dependencies track calls to external services like databases, REST APIs, or Azure services. While useful for monitoring performance bottlenecks, they are not designed to directly trigger autoscaling rules based on application workload."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "An Application Insights event"
      correct: false
      explain: "Events are discrete occurrences in your application like button clicks or custom business events. While useful for analytics, they don't provide the continuous numerical data needed for autoscaling decisions based on workload patterns."

You work as a Solutions Architect for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that provides cloud certification courses to thousands of students globally. Mark, the CTO, has tasked you with developing a Course Enrollment Service that automatically processes student registrations, generates certificates, and sends notification emails. 

The service experiences variable load throughout the day, with peak enrollment periods during course launches and promotional events. To optimize costs while maintaining performance, the service must automatically scale based on the number of enrollment actions it is currently processing. 

You need to implement Application Insights to monitor the service and trigger automatic scaling when the workload increases or decreases.

Which Azure Application Insights data model should you use to enable autoscaling based on enrollment processing activity?
