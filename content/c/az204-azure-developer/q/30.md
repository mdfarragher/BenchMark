title: "Configure Application Insights Availability Tests"
type: "question"
layout: "multiple"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Integration"
      correct: false
      explain: "Integration tests verify that different components of an application work together correctly. While valuable for development, they're not an Application Insights availability test type. Availability tests focus on monitoring external endpoint accessibility from various geographic locations, not internal component integration."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Multi-step web"
      correct: true
      explain: "Multi-step web tests (also called multi-step availability tests) allow you to record a sequence of web requests and replay them from multiple locations worldwide. They can test complex user scenarios, validate response codes, and send alerts when endpoints become unresponsive. This test type meets the requirement for monitoring global availability."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "URL ping"
      correct: true
      explain: "URL ping tests (now replaced by Standard tests) send HTTP requests to a web app endpoint from multiple global locations at regular intervals. They measure availability, responsiveness, and can trigger alerts to support staff when the app doesn't respond or returns error codes. This simple test type is ideal for basic availability monitoring."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Unit"
      correct: false
      explain: "Unit tests validate individual functions or methods in isolation during development. They're part of the development lifecycle, not monitoring infrastructure. Application Insights availability tests monitor deployed applications from external locations, while unit tests run locally during development and CI/CD pipelines."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "Load"
      correct: false
      explain: "Load tests measure application performance under high user load or traffic volume. While important for capacity planning, they're not an Application Insights availability test type. Availability tests focus on uptime and responsiveness from various locations, not performance under stress."

You work as a Site Reliability Engineer for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that delivers certification courses to students worldwide. Mark, the Operations Manager, has deployed the Student Learning Portal, an ASP.NET web application hosted on Azure App Service, which students use to access courses, take quizzes, and download certificates. The application serves students from North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia, and must maintain high availability to ensure students can always access their learning materials. You've implemented Application Insights telemetry to monitor the application's performance and usage patterns. Now you need to configure proactive monitoring to test the web app's availability and responsiveness from various points around the world at regular intervals (every 5 minutes). If the app is not responding, returns error codes, or response times exceed acceptable thresholds, the system must automatically send an alert notification to the support staff so they can investigate and resolve issues before students are significantly impacted. The monitoring solution should validate both simple endpoint availability and complex multi-page user workflows like the login and course enrollment process.

Which two test types can you configure in Application Insights to meet these requirements?
