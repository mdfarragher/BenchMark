      title: "1. Build a new application image by using the dockerfile 2. Tag the image with the fully qualified path to the registry 3. Log in to the registry 4. Push the image"
      correct: true
      explain: "This is the correct sequence for deploying a Docker image to ACR. First, build the image from the Dockerfile, then tag it with the registry's fully qualified path (like myregistry.azurecr.io/imagename:tag), authenticate to the registry using 'az acr login' or docker login, and finally push the tagged image to ACR where it becomes available for deployment."

      title: "1. Build a new application image by using the dockerfile 2. Download the image to your local computer 3. Tag the image with the fully qualified path to the registry 4. Push the image"
      correct: false
      explain: "After building an image locally with Docker, the image is already on your local computer—there's no separate 'download' step needed. You build locally, tag the local image, authenticate to ACR, and then push. Including a download step is redundant and not part of the ACR deployment workflow."

      title: "1. Tag the image with a new build number 2. Build a new application image by using the dockerfile 3. Log in to the registry 4. Push the image"
      correct: false
      explain: "You cannot tag an image before it exists. The image must be built first using the Dockerfile before you can apply any tags to it. Additionally, simply tagging with a build number isn't sufficient—you need to tag with the full registry path for ACR to accept the push."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "1. Log in to the registry 2. Pull the image 3. Tag the image with the fully qualified path to the registry 4. Push the image"
      correct: false
      explain: "Pulling an image downloads an existing image from a registry, but you need to build a new version of your application from the Dockerfile. Pulling would get an old version; you need to build the new version locally first before tagging and pushing it to ACR."

You work as a Container Platform Engineer for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that delivers certification courses to students worldwide. Mark, the DevOps Manager, has tasked you with deploying a new version of the Course Assignment Grader application to Azure Container Registry (ACR). The application is a containerized service that automatically grades student coding assignments and provides feedback. You've updated the application code to improve grading accuracy and fix several bugs, and you have a Dockerfile ready that defines how to build the new container image. The image needs to be made available in ACR so that it can be deployed to the production Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster where it will process student submissions. The ACR instance is named **mdftpro-acr** and is already provisioned in your Azure subscription.

Which actions should you perform in sequence to deploy the new version to ACR?
