title: "Apply Feature Gate Attribute to Controller Action"

      title: "FeatureGate"
      correct: true
      explain: "The FeatureGate attribute is specifically designed for Azure App Configuration feature flags in ASP.NET Core. It enables or disables controller actions based on feature flag state. When applied to a controller action, it checks if the specified feature (like 'export') is enabled before allowing the action to execute, providing dynamic feature toggles without code changes."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Route"
      correct: false
      explain: "The Route attribute defines URL routing patterns for controller actions, mapping HTTP requests to specific methods. It has nothing to do with feature flags or conditional execution based on App Configuration settings. Route is about URL mapping, not feature management."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "ServiceFilter"
      correct: false
      explain: "ServiceFilter applies action filters that are resolved from dependency injection, typically for cross-cutting concerns like logging or validation. While filters can implement custom logic, ServiceFilter isn't designed for feature flag management and would require custom implementation rather than using the built-in feature management framework."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "TypeFilter"
      correct: false
      explain: "TypeFilter creates and applies action filters directly without dependency injection. Like ServiceFilter, it's for general-purpose filtering logic but isn't built for feature flag evaluation. Using TypeFilter would mean manually implementing feature flag logic instead of leveraging the Microsoft.FeatureManagement library's FeatureGate attribute."

You work as a Full Stack Developer for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that delivers certification courses to students worldwide. Claire, the Product Manager, has asked you to implement a new data export feature in the Student Learning Portal that allows trainers to export student progress reports and quiz results to Excel files. To enable progressive rollout and testing, the feature will be controlled by an Azure App Configuration feature flag named "Export". You've created the App Configuration store with the feature flag currently set to "Off" state for initial testing. The ASP.NET Core application includes a navigation menu with an "Export Data" link that should only be visible when the feature is enabled. Now you need to protect the controller action method that handles export requests so that it only executes when the feature flag is enabled.

| Property      | Value                  |
| ------------- | ---------------------- |
| Key           | Export                 |
| Label         | Export                 |
| State         | Off                    |

The view markup uses the feature tag helper:

```xml
<feature name="export">
	<li class="nav-item">
		<a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-area="" asp-controller="home" asp-action="export">Export Data</a>
	</li>
</feature>
```

Which controller attribute should you use to conditionally enable the export action based on the feature flag?
