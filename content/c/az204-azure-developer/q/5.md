      correct: false
      explain: "While Event Grid-based blob triggers can provide near-instant response times under normal conditions, the Consumption plan cannot guarantee the 60-second maximum response requirement in all cases. When the function app goes idle, the Consumption plan can have cold start delays of up to 10 minutes in the worst case. Since the question explicitly states that processing must begin within 60 seconds in all cases, the Consumption plan does not meet this requirement."

      title: "No"
      correct: true
      explain: "The Consumption plan cannot meet the requirement because it has a worst-case cold start latency of up to 10 minutes when the function app has gone idle. While the Consumption plan is cost-effective with automatic scaling and pay-per-execution pricing, it cannot guarantee the 60-second maximum response time in all cases. To meet this requirement, you would need a Premium plan (always-ready instances) or a Dedicated (App Service) plan to ensure the function app remains warm and responsive."

You work as a Solutions Architect for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that delivers certification courses worldwide. Mark, the Product Manager, has asked you to develop a Student Photo Management service for the learning portal. Trainers and students upload profile photos and course completion certificates to a web service, which stores these images in Azure Blob Storage using a General-purpose V2 storage account. 

To provide a better mobile experience for students accessing the portal on their phones, the system must automatically generate and save mobile-optimized versions of each uploaded image. Due to the responsive design requirements of the mobile app, the photo processing workflow must begin within 60 seconds of the original image being uploaded to ensure students see their photos quickly when they log in.

Does creating an Azure Function app that uses the **Consumption** hosting model with a blob upload trigger meet this requirement?
