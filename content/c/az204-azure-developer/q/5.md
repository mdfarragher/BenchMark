      title: "Yes"
      correct: true
      explain: "An Azure Function with a blob trigger on the Consumption plan can meet the requirement of starting photo processing within one minute. While the Consumption plan can have delays of up to 10 minutes if the app goes idle, Event Grid-based blob triggers provide near-instant response times. For a SaaS photo management service with regular uploads, the function app is unlikely to go idle, making this solution cost-effective and responsive enough to meet the sub-one-minute requirement."

      title: "No"
      correct: false
      explain: "While there are potential latency concerns with Consumption plan blob triggers, this solution can actually meet the goal when implemented with Event Grid-based triggers. The Consumption plan provides automatic scaling and pay-per-execution pricing, which is ideal for processing photo uploads that occur at irregular intervals throughout the day."

You work as a Solutions Architect for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that delivers certification courses worldwide. Claire, the Product Manager, has asked you to develop a Student Photo Management service for the learning portal. Trainers and students upload profile photos and course completion certificates to a web service, which stores these images in Azure Blob Storage using a General-purpose V2 storage account. To provide a better mobile experience for students accessing the portal on their phones, the system must automatically generate and save mobile-optimized versions of each uploaded image. Due to the responsive design requirements of the mobile app, the photo processing workflow must begin within 60 seconds of the original image being uploaded to ensure students see their photos quickly when they log in.

Does creating an Azure Function app that uses the Consumption hosting model with a blob upload trigger meet this requirement?
