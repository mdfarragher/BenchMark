title: "Configure Storage for Point-in-Time Restore"

      title: "Enable the change feed on the storage account to begin capturing and recording changes"
      correct: true
      explain: "The change feed is a prerequisite for point-in-time restore on blob storage. It captures a log of all create, modify, and delete operations on blobs and blob metadata. Point-in-time restore uses this change feed data to roll back containers to their state at a previous point in time, enabling recovery from accidental corruption or deletions during app testing."

      title: "Create a snapshot of the blob in the hot tier"
      correct: false
      explain: "Blob snapshots capture read-only copies of individual blobs at specific moments, but they require manual creation and management for each blob. Point-in-time restore operates at the container level and automatically tracks changes, making it more practical for restoring large numbers of blobs to a previous state without managing individual snapshots."

      title: "Configure object replication and specify replication rules"
      correct: false
      explain: "Object replication asynchronously copies blobs between storage accounts in different regions for disaster recovery and redundancy. While useful for geographic protection, it doesn't enable point-in-time restore within a single account. Replication is about copying data elsewhere, not maintaining historical states for rollback."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Configure an immutability policy that is scoped to a blob version"
      correct: false
      explain: "Immutability policies make blob versions unmodifiable for compliance and legal hold scenarios (WORM storage). While they work with versioning, they prevent changes rather than enabling restoration to previous states. Immutability is about preventing modifications, not supporting time-based recovery from accidental corruption."

You work as a Cloud Storage Engineer for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that delivers certification courses to students worldwide. Claire, the Data Protection Manager, has deployed a globally distributed application that stores student course materials, assignment submissions, and quiz results across multiple Azure Blob Storage containers. You've already enabled versioning to track changes and soft delete to recover accidentally deleted blobs. However, during application development and testing, bugs and incorrect code have frequently corrupted data across numerous blobs—sometimes affecting hundreds of files simultaneously. When corruption occurs, manually recovering individual blob versions is time-consuming and error-prone. The development process requires the ability to quickly restore entire containers to their state from a previous day for testing scenarios, effectively rolling back all blobs to a known-good state before corruption occurred.

What should you configure on the storage account to support point-in-time restore capabilities?
