      title: "3"
      correct: false
      explain: "While 3 matches the number of instances per App Service Plan, this doesn't align with the data structure or scaling needs. The data is organized by highway (6 highways), not by instance count. With only 3 partitions, you'd have suboptimal parallelism since multiple highways would share partitions, reducing throughput and increasing latency when processing time-series data for different highways."

      title: "4"
      correct: false
      explain: "While 4 matches the number of departments consuming the data, Event Hub partitions should be based on the logical partitioning of the input data, not the number of consumers. Multiple consumer groups can read from the same set of partitions. With 4 partitions for 6 highways, some highways would share partitions, reducing the parallelism available for data ingestion and processing."

      title: "6"
      correct: true
      explain: "Six partitions match the number of highways being monitored, providing the optimal data structure for maximum throughput and minimum latency. By using the highway identifier as the partition key, all traffic data for a given highway goes to a specific partition, ensuring ordered processing within each highway. This allows parallel processing of all six highways simultaneously and enables each WebJob to efficiently process data for specific highways without cross-partition queries."

      title: "12"
      correct: false
      explain: "While 12 partitions (4 departments × 3 instances) would work, it's excessive for this scenario and would reduce efficiency. Event Hub partition counts should match the logical data structure and scale needs. With only 6 highways generating data, having 12 partitions means half would be underutilized. Over-partitioning increases management overhead without providing throughput benefits when the partition key (highway) has only 6 unique values."

You work as a Streaming Data Engineer for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that delivers certification courses to students worldwide. Mark, the Real-Time Analytics Lead, is building a traffic monitoring system for a hands-on Azure training course. The system monitors traffic along six highways, collecting data from IoT sensors and producing time-series analysis reports for each highway. Data from traffic sensors is ingested into Azure Event Hub and consumed by four departments—Road Safety, Traffic Planning, Environmental Impact, and Student Training—each running an Azure Web App with a WebJob that processes incoming Event Hub data and displays highway-specific time-series reports. All web apps run on App Service Plans with three instances each. The system must maximize data throughput and minimize latency when processing traffic sensor data from the six highways.

Which partition count should you configure for the Event Hub to achieve maximum throughput and minimum latency?
