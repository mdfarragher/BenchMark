title: "Restore Soft-Deleted Blobs and Snapshots"

      title: "The data blob"
      correct: true
      explain: "The data blob can be restored because it was soft-deleted in the final step (system error). When blob soft delete is enabled, deleted blobs are retained for the configured retention period and can be restored by calling the Undelete operation. Restoring the base blob also automatically restores all soft-deleted snapshots that were deleted during the soft-delete retention period."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Snapshot 1"
      correct: false
      explain: "Snapshot 1 was explicitly deleted before the system error occurred, which soft-deleted it. However, when the data blob and all snapshots were deleted by the system error, Snapshot 1 had already been soft-deleted. When you undelete the base blob, Azure restores snapshots that were deleted during the same retention period, but Snapshot 1 was deleted in a separate operation before the final deletion. While soft delete retains it initially, the documented behavior indicates that explicitly deleted snapshots may not be automatically restored when you undelete the base blob."

      title: "Snapshot 2"
      correct: true
      explain: "Snapshot 2 can be restored because it was deleted as part of the system error that deleted the data blob. When you call Undelete on the base blob, Azure automatically restores any snapshots that were deleted during the soft-delete retention period along with the blob itself. Since Snapshot 2 was deleted in the same operation as the base blob (the system error), it will be restored when you restore the data blob."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "None of the resources can be restored"
      correct: false
      explain: "This is incorrect because soft delete is enabled on the storage account. Soft delete protects blobs and their snapshots from accidental deletion by retaining them for a configured retention period. Both the data blob and Snapshot 2 can be successfully restored during the retention period by calling the Undelete operation on the base blob."

You work as a Cloud Storage Engineer for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that delivers certification courses to students worldwide. Mark, the Data Protection Lead, has deployed an application that stores student course progress data in an Azure Blob named **data**. The application creates blob snapshots to allow reverting to earlier application states—for example, before a student completes a quiz or updates their profile. The Azure storage account has soft delete enabled with a retention period to protect against accidental deletions. During application development and testing, the following sequence of operations occurs:

1. The blob is updated (student completes a course module)
2. Snapshot 1 is created (captures state before quiz)
3. Snapshot 2 is created (captures state after quiz)
4. Snapshot 1 is deleted (cleanup of intermediate state)
5. A system error then deletes the data blob and all remaining snapshots

You need to determine which resources can be successfully restored using the soft delete feature.

Which Azure resources can be successfully restored?
