title: "Evaluate Service Bus for POS Data Collection"

      title: "Yes, Service Bus topic with correlation filter meets all requirements"
      correct: true
      explain: "Service Bus topics with correlation filters satisfy all requirements for this scenario. Topics allow multiple subscribers to receive correlated data, correlation filters enable routing based on device identifier properties, and Service Bus supports the data volume from 2,000 stores (maximum 10 MB per day per store totaling 20 GB daily is within Service Bus Premium capabilities with 1 MB message sizes). Service Bus integrates with Azure Functions or Logic Apps to process messages and store them in Blob Storage, and it scales easily as new stores open."

      title: "No, Service Bus topics cannot handle the required data volume"
      correct: false
      explain: "Service Bus Premium tier supports 1 MB message sizes and high throughput with messaging units, making it capable of handling 2-10 MB per device per day. While devices would need to chunk data into smaller messages, Service Bus can handle the total volume from 2,000 stores. The limitation isn't capacity but rather efficiency—Service Bus is over-engineered for this simple telemetry collection scenario compared to Event Hubs."

      title: "No, correlation filters cannot be used for device identifiers"
      correct: false
      explain: "Correlation filters in Service Bus topics can match on custom message properties, including device identifiers. You can set the device identifier as a custom property or in the CorrelationId field, then create subscription filters to route messages based on device ID. Correlation filters are specifically designed for this type of property-based message routing."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "No, Service Bus does not integrate with Azure Blob Storage"
      correct: false
      explain: "While Service Bus doesn't have direct integration like Event Hubs Capture, it integrates seamlessly with Blob Storage through Azure Functions, Logic Apps, or custom applications that consume messages from Service Bus topics and write data to Blob Storage. This is a standard integration pattern for message processing workflows."

You work as a Cloud Integration Engineer for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that delivers certification courses to students worldwide. Claire, the Retail Solutions Lead, is building a point-of-sale (POS) data collection system for a hands-on Azure training lab. The system collects transaction data from 2,000 training store locations worldwide, with each store running 1 to 5 POS devices. Each device generates approximately 2 MB of transaction data every 24 hours including course material purchases, certification exam vouchers, and student enrollment fees. The collected data must be stored in Azure Blob Storage for analytics and reporting, with data correlated by device identifier to track individual device performance and transaction patterns. The solution must scale to accommodate additional stores opening as MDFT Pro expands its global training presence.

You need to implement a messaging solution to receive the POS device data.

**Solution:** Provision an Azure Service Bus. Configure a topic to receive the device data by using a correlation filter.

Does the solution meet the requirements?
