title: "Configure Automatic Cosmos DB Index Updates"

answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Set the value of the EnableScanInQuery option to True"
      correct: false
      explain: "EnableScanInQuery is a query execution option that allows queries to perform scans when indexes aren't available for certain query paths. This setting doesn't control how or when indexes are updated—it only affects query behavior when indexes are missing. To ensure indexes update automatically, you need to configure the indexing policy's mode and automatic property."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Set the value of the automatic property of the indexing policy to False"
      correct: false
      explain: "Setting the automatic property to false disables automatic indexing entirely, meaning items won't be indexed as they're created, updated, or deleted. This would prevent indexes from updating at all. To ensure indexes update with item changes, you need automatic set to true (which is the default) and use an appropriate indexing mode."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Set the indexing mode to Consistent"
      correct: true
      explain: "Consistent indexing mode updates the index synchronously as you create, update, or delete items. The index is updated immediately with each write operation, ensuring queries always return up-to-date results. This is the default and recommended mode for containers that will be queried. Items are indexed before the write operation completes, guaranteeing consistency between data and indexes."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Set the indexing mode to Lazy"
      correct: false
      explain: "Lazy indexing mode is deprecated and cannot be selected for newly created containers. While it updates indexes when the container is idle (rather than synchronously), queries return eventually consistent results and may miss recently added items. Microsoft recommends Consistent mode for any containers that will be queried, as lazy indexing can result in incomplete or stale query results."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "Set the indexing mode to None"
      correct: false
      explain: "None indexing mode completely disables indexing for the container. Items are not indexed at all, making queries impossible except for point reads using the document ID and partition key. This mode is only appropriate for containers used purely as key-value stores where no queries will be performed. It's the opposite of what's needed for automatic index updates."

You work as a NoSQL Database Administrator for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that delivers certification courses to students worldwide. Claire, the Data Platform Lead, has deployed an Azure Cosmos DB instance to store course catalog data, student enrollment records, and instructor profiles for the Learning Management System. The application performs frequent queries to search for courses by category, find students by certification level, and locate instructors by expertise area. These queries must return accurate, up-to-date results immediately after items are created, updated, or deleted—for example, when a new course is published, it should appear in search results right away, and when student enrollment status changes, queries must reflect the updated information. You need to configure the Cosmos DB indexing policy to ensure indexes are automatically updated as items change.

What should you configure to ensure the index is updated automatically as items are created, updated, or deleted?
