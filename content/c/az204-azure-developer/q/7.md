title: "Serve Static Content from Training Website"
type: "question"
layout: "multiple"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Configure the Azure App Service Local Cache feature and set the app setting WEBSITE_LOCAL_CACHE_SIZEINMB value"
      correct: false
      explain: "Local Cache is designed to improve performance of the app itself by caching the content directory on the VM instance, but it doesn't provide global content delivery or reduce bandwidth costs. This feature is for app performance optimization, not for serving static content to end users efficiently."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Configure App Service networking to create a Content Delivery Network profile and endpoint"
      correct: true
      explain: "Creating a CDN profile and endpoint for App Service enables global distribution of static content through edge servers. This reduces latency for students accessing course materials from different geographic locations and offloads static content delivery from the App Service, improving overall performance."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Update the Azure Traffic Manager routing method to priority"
      correct: false
      explain: "Traffic Manager provides DNS-level routing to direct users to different service endpoints, but it doesn't cache or serve static content. Changing the routing method to priority would only affect which endpoint receives traffic, not how static content is delivered or cached."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Create a nested Azure Traffic Manager profile. Configure the parent profile to the performance traffic routing method and the child profile to the priority traffic routing method"
      correct: false
      explain: "While nested Traffic Manager profiles provide sophisticated routing capabilities, they don't address static content delivery. Traffic Manager operates at the DNS level and doesn't cache content or improve static asset delivery performance like a CDN does."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "Store all static content in Azure Blob Storage. Enable Azure Content Delivery Network for the storage account"
      correct: true
      explain: "This is the recommended approach for static content delivery. Blob Storage provides cost-effective storage for static assets like images, CSS, and JavaScript files, while enabling CDN integration caches this content at edge locations worldwide, providing fast access with low latency and reduced bandwidth costs."

You work as a Web Application Developer for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that offers professional certification courses to students around the world. Mark, the Lead Solutions Architect, has been reviewing the performance and costs of the company's public-facing training portal. The website includes substantial static content such as course catalog images, PDF brochures, training video thumbnails, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript libraries that are currently served directly from the web server. With students accessing the portal from various geographic regions across North America, Europe, and Asia, the current approach results in higher latency for international students and increased bandwidth costs for the organization. Mark has asked you to implement a solution to serve static content more efficiently while reducing operational costs.

What are two ways to achieve this goal?
