### Question 73

A company is developing a solution that allows smart refrigerators to send temperature information to a central location. You have an existing Service Bus.  
The solution must receive and store messages until they can be processed. You create an Azure Service Bus instance by providing a name, pricing tier, subscription, resource group, and location.  
You need to complete the configuration.  
Which Azure CLI command should you run?

```bash
# command A
az servicebus namespace create
	——resource—group myGroup
	——name myNs
	——location myLoc

# command B
az servicebus queue create
	——resource-group myGroup
	—-namespace-name myNs
	——name myQueue
	
# command C
az servicebus namespace authorization-rule keys list
	——resource-group myGroup
	——namespace-name myNs
	—-name RootManageSharedAccessKey
	—-query primaryConnectionString

# command D
az group create
	——name myGroup
	——location myLoc
```
