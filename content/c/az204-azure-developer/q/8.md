title: "Deploy Docker Application to Azure App Service"

answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "add docker"
      correct: false
      explain: "There is no 'add docker' command in the Azure CLI webapp command set. The Azure CLI doesn't use an 'add' verb for Docker configuration operations. Instead, configuration changes use the 'config' verb with specific subcommands."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "add container"
      correct: false
      explain: "While 'container' is the correct resource type, 'add' is not the appropriate verb for configuring container settings in Azure CLI. The proper approach is to use 'config' to modify the container configuration of an existing web app."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "config docker set"
      correct: false
      explain: "The 'docker' subcommand is not used in the Azure CLI for container configuration. Azure CLI has moved to using the more generic 'container' terminology instead of 'docker' to accommodate various container runtimes, not just Docker."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "config container set"
      correct: true
      explain: "This is the correct Azure CLI command for configuring a custom container image for an App Service web app. The command 'az webapp config container set' allows you to specify the Docker image, registry credentials, and other container-related settings for the web app."

You work as a Cloud Migration Specialist for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that delivers technology certification courses to students globally. Mark, the Application Services Manager, is migrating the Student Learning Hub application from on-premises infrastructure to Azure. 

The Learning Hub is an ASP.NET Core web application that runs in Docker and is currently mapped to the mdftpro-learning.com domain. A resource group named **LearningHubResourceGroup** has been created in the **WestUS** region, and it contains an App Service Plan named **AppServiceLinuxDockerPlan**. 

You need to provision an App Service Web App to host the Docker image and map the custom domain to the web app so students can continue accessing their courses without disruption.

How should you complete the following Azure CLI script?

```bash
appName="LearningHub$random"
location="WestUS"
dockerHubContainerPath="MDFTPro/learninghub:v1"
fqdn="www.mdftpro-learning.com"

az webapp create \
  --name $appName \
  --plan AppServiceLinuxDockerPlan \
  --resource-group LearningHubResourceGroup

az webapp config hostname add \
  --webapp-name $appName \
  --resource-group LearningHubResourceGroup \
  --hostname $fqdn

az webapp _____________ \
  --docker-custom-image-name $dockerHubContainerPath \
  --name $appName \
  --resource-group LearningHubResourceGroup
```
