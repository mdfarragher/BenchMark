title: "Enrich Telemetry with Additional Properties"

layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Sampling"
      correct: false
      explain: "Sampling reduces the volume of telemetry sent to Application Insights by selectively transmitting a percentage of data. It doesn't add or modify properties on telemetry items; instead, it controls how much data is sent to maintain statistical accuracy while reducing costs."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Telemetry initializer"
      correct: true
      explain: "Telemetry initializers are specifically designed to enrich telemetry with additional properties or override existing ones before data is sent to Application Insights. They run early in the telemetry processing pipeline, allowing you to add contextual information like user roles, session details, or custom business data to every telemetry item."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Telemetry processor"
      correct: false
      explain: "Telemetry processors are designed to filter out or completely replace telemetry items. While they can modify data, their primary purpose is to control which telemetry items are sent to Application Insights, not to enrich items with additional properties."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Telemetry channel"
      correct: false
      explain: "Telemetry channels handle buffering and transmission of telemetry data to Application Insights. They manage how data is sent but don't modify or enrich the content of telemetry items with additional properties."

You work as a Data Analytics Developer for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that delivers professional certification courses to students worldwide. Mark, the Analytics Team Lead, has deployed a Student Progress Tracking application built with Java to Azure, instrumented with the Application Insights SDK. 

The application tracks student interactions, course completions, and quiz performance. Mark needs to enhance the telemetry data by adding custom properties to every telemetry item—such as the student's enrolled course category (Azure, AWS, Google Cloud), their subscription tier (Free, Premium, Enterprise), and their geographic region. Additionally, some default properties need to be overridden with more meaningful business context. 

These enrichments must happen before the telemetry is processed and sent to Application Insights so that the dashboards and queries can segment and filter data by these important business dimensions.

Which Application Insights SDK feature should you use to enrich telemetry with additional properties or override existing ones?
