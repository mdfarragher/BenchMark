title: "Replace or Discard Telemetry Items"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Sampling"
      correct: false
      explain: "Sampling reduces telemetry volume by randomly selecting a percentage of telemetry items to send, but it doesn't give you control over which specific items to discard. Sampling is statistical and automatic, not based on conditional logic or specific telemetry content."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Telemetry initializer"
      correct: false
      explain: "Telemetry initializers are designed to add or modify properties on telemetry items, not to remove them entirely. While you can change values, initializers don't have the capability to discard items or prevent them from being sent to Application Insights."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Telemetry processor"
      correct: true
      explain: "Telemetry processors allow you to implement custom logic to completely replace or discard specific telemetry items based on any criteria you define. They run after initializers and before the channel, giving you full control to filter out unwanted telemetry, modify items, or prevent certain data from being sent to Application Insights."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Telemetry channel"
      correct: false
      explain: "Telemetry channels handle the buffering and transmission of telemetry to Application Insights. They operate at the transport level and don't provide logic to selectively discard or replace individual telemetry items based on their content or properties."

You work as a Security Compliance Engineer for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that provides certification courses to students globally. Mark, the Chief Information Security Officer, has deployed a Learning Management System built with Java to Azure, instrumented with Application Insights SDK for monitoring. 

Due to privacy regulations and GDPR compliance requirements, certain telemetry items must not be sent to Application Insights. Specifically, any requests containing personally identifiable student information (PII) such as social security numbers in URLs, detailed authentication tokens in custom events, or student medical records in dependencies. Additionally, some telemetry items need to be completely replaced with sanitized versions before transmission. 

The solution must implement conditional logic to examine each telemetry item and either allow it, modify it completely, or prevent it from being sent to Application Insights based on the data it contains.

Which Application Insights SDK feature should you use to completely replace or discard telemetry items?
