title: "Document Archive Tier Data Recovery SLA"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "At least two days"
      correct: false
      explain: "Archive tier rehydration does not take two days under normal circumstances. Microsoft's documentation indicates much faster recovery times, with standard priority rehydration completing within 15 hours and high priority completing in under 1 hour for objects under 10 GB."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Between one and 15 hours"
      correct: true
      explain: "Standard priority rehydration from the archive tier takes up to 15 hours for objects under 10 GB, while high priority rehydration can complete in under 1 hour. This range represents the expected recovery time window that should be documented in the SLA for customer data access."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "At least one day"
      correct: false
      explain: "While technically a blob could be rehydrated within one day (24 hours), this timeframe is unnecessarily conservative. The actual expected maximum time for standard priority rehydration is 15 hours, making a one-day SLA less accurate than the actual service capabilities."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Between zero and 60 minutes"
      correct: false
      explain: "While high priority rehydration can complete in under 1 hour for small objects (under 10 GB), this is not guaranteed for all scenarios. Standard priority rehydration takes significantly longer (up to 15 hours), so documenting a 60-minute maximum would create unrealistic customer expectations."

You work as a Storage Solutions Architect for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that provides certification courses to students worldwide. Mark, the Data Management Lead, has implemented an Azure Blob Storage solution to store course recordings, completed student assignments, and historical assessment data. 

To optimize storage costs, Azure Blob Storage lifecycle management has been configured to automatically move all course content to the archive tier after 30 days, as this data is rarely accessed but must be retained for compliance and reference purposes. Students and trainers occasionally request access to archived course materials and expect reasonable access times. 

Mark has asked you to document the minimum service-level agreement (SLA) for data recovery that should be communicated to customers when they request access to archived content.

Which SLA should you document for recovering data from the archive tier?
