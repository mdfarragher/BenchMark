title: "Track Aggregate Telemetry in Application Insights"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "TrackEvent"
      correct: false
      explain: "TrackEvent is used to log discrete events or occurrences in your application, such as button clicks or feature usage. While useful for analytics, events don't provide numerical aggregation capabilities needed for tracking cumulative metrics like total API call counts or average response times."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "TrackTrace"
      correct: false
      explain: "TrackTrace is designed for diagnostic logging and captures text-based log messages. It's used for debugging and understanding application flow but doesn't support numerical aggregations or statistical calculations that metrics require."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "TrackDependency"
      correct: false
      explain: "TrackDependency records calls to external services like databases, REST APIs, or Azure services. While it tracks timing and success information, it's specifically for monitoring external dependencies, not for implementing custom aggregated metrics for your own API calls."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "TrackException"
      correct: false
      explain: "TrackException is used to log exceptions and errors that occur in your application. It's designed for error tracking and diagnostics, not for aggregating numerical telemetry data or implementing custom performance metrics."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "TrackMetric"
      correct: true
      explain: "TrackMetric is specifically designed to send custom numerical measurements to Application Insights, including pre-aggregated values. It allows you to track cumulative statistics like total API calls, average processing times, and custom business metrics. The SDK can pre-aggregate metric values locally before sending them, making it efficient for high-volume telemetry."

You work as an API Developer for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that provides cloud certification courses to students globally. Mark, the Platform Monitoring Lead, has asked you to implement comprehensive monitoring for the Course Content Delivery API that serves course videos, quizzes, and study materials to students. 

The API handles requests from multiple clients including the student web portal, mobile applications, and third-party learning management systems. To understand API performance and usage patterns, you need to track aggregated telemetry values such as the total number of API calls per endpoint, average response times across different geographic regions, and peak concurrent request counts during high-traffic periods like exam seasons. These aggregated metrics will be used to trigger auto-scaling rules, generate performance dashboards, and alert the operations team when thresholds are exceeded.

Which Application Insights API method should you use to implement aggregate telemetry tracking for the API calls?
