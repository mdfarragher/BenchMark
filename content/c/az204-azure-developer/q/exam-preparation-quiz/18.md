title: "Configure API Management Policy for Large Requests"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "The original HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) will be preserved when routing large requests"
      correct: true
      explain: "The rewrite-uri and set-backend-service policies modify the URI path and backend URL respectively, but they do not change the HTTP method. If a client sends a GET request, it will remain a GET request even after these policies are applied. To change the HTTP method, you would need to explicitly use the set-method policy."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "All requests will be automatically converted to PUT regardless of the original HTTP method"
      correct: false
      explain: "The rewrite-uri template of '/put' only changes the URI path to '/put', not the HTTP method. The template parameter specifies the new path structure, not the HTTP verb. The original HTTP method sent by the client is preserved unless you use a set-method policy."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Only POST requests will be redirected to the new backend service"
      correct: false
      explain: "The policy condition is based on body size (Content-Length header), not HTTP method. Any request with a body larger than 512,000 bytes will match the condition, regardless of whether it's a POST, PUT, PATCH, or other method that supports request bodies."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "GET requests will fail because they cannot have a body larger than 512KB"
      correct: false
      explain: "While HTTP GET requests typically don't include request bodies according to best practices, the policy will still evaluate the Content-Length header if present. However, the policy doesn't cause GET requests to fail—it simply rewrites the URI and backend service when the condition is met."

You work as an API Integration Specialist for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that delivers cloud certification courses to students worldwide. Mark, the API Services Manager, has implemented Azure API Management to handle the Course Content Upload API, which allows trainers to submit course materials, videos, and large presentation files. 

To optimize backend resource allocation and handle large file uploads more efficiently, Mark has configured an API policy that checks the Content-Length header of incoming requests. For requests with bodies smaller than 512KB, the standard v1.0 API endpoint is used. 

However, when trainers upload large course videos or comprehensive study materials exceeding 512KB, the requests need to be routed to a specialized v9.1 backend service optimized for large file handling. The policy uses **rewrite-uri** to change the path to "/put" and **set-backend-service** to redirect to "mdftpro.com/api/9.1/" for these large uploads.

What happens to the HTTP method when a client sends a large request (body size > 512KB) with any HTTP verb (GET, POST, PUT, etc.)?
