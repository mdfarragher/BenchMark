      title: "Yes, GET requests will be redirected to 'mdftpro.com/api/9.1/put'"
      correct: true
      explain: "The rewrite-uri policy changes the path to '/put' and set-backend-service sets the base URL to 'mdftpro.com/api/9.1/', so the backend request will be sent to 'mdftpro.com/api/9.1/put'. The policy evaluates the Content-Length header and can match a GET request that includes a body; although GET bodies are uncommon, they are not forbidden, so when the condition is met the request will be routed. These policies do not change the HTTP method, so the request remains a GET unless an explicit set-method policy is applied."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "No, the redirect URL will be 'mdftpro.com/api/9.1/get' preserving the method"
      correct: false
      explain: "The rewrite-uri template explicitly specifies '/put' as the new path. The policy doesn't dynamically adjust the URI based on the HTTP method—it uses the literal template value provided. The path becomes '/put' regardless of whether the request method is GET, POST, or any other verb."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Yes, GET requests will be redirected to 'mdftpro.com/api/9.1/put' and the HTTP method will change from GET to PUT"
      correct: false
      explain: "The rewrite-uri policy only changes the URI path component, not the HTTP method. Unless a set-method policy is explicitly added, the original HTTP verb is preserved. A GET request with the path '/put' is still a GET request, just with a different path."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "No, GET requests with a body are invalid  and will not be routed at all"
      correct: false
      explain: "GET requests with a body are rare, but definitely valid. If a GET request does include a body exceeding the threshold, the rewrite-uri and set-backend-service policies will route it to that backend."

You work as an API Gateway Administrator for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that provides professional certification courses globally. Mark, the Integration Architect, has configured an Azure API Management policy for the Student Assignment Submission API. 

The policy examines the Content-Length header to route requests appropriately. When students submit assignments with large attachments (body size > 512KB), such as project portfolios or video presentations, the policy applies two transformations: 

1. It uses **rewrite-uri** with template="/put" to change the request path
2. It uses **set-backend-service** with base-url="mdftpro.com/api/9.1/" to point to a backend optimized for large file handling. 

A developer has questioned whether a GET request with a body size larger than 512KB would be redirected to the URL "mdftpro.com/api/9.1/put".

What is the behavior when these two policies are applied to a request meeting the size condition?
