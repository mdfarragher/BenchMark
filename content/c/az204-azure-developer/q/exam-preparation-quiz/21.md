      title: "Yes, publishing to a system topic meets all requirements"
      correct: false
      explain: "System topics are created automatically by Azure services (like Storage, Service Bus, etc.) to publish their own events. You cannot manually publish custom events to system topics—only the Azure service that owns the system topic can publish to it. For custom application events, you need a custom topic instead."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "No, use a custom topic instead of a system topic"
      correct: true
      explain: "Custom topics allow you to publish your own application events and support Microsoft Entra ID authentication for both publishing and event delivery. You can create a single custom topic endpoint, apply event type filtering in subscriptions, and create individual subscriptions for each customer with appropriate access controls using Entra ID roles."

You work as an Event-Driven Architecture Specialist for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that delivers certification courses to thousands of students globally. Claire, the Platform Integration Lead, has tasked you with implementing a real-time notification system using Azure Event Grid. The system needs to push near-real-time information to students, trainers, and administrators when important events occur—such as course enrollments, quiz completions, certificate generations, assignment submissions, and trainer feedback. The solution must support hundreds of different event types and send these events to thousands of customers (students and trainers using the mobile app, web portal, and third-party integrations). Each customer needs to filter events by type to receive only the events relevant to them (for example, students only receive their own quiz results, while trainers receive all quiz results for their courses). The authentication and authorization for both publishing events and receiving them must be handled using Microsoft Entra ID, and all events must be published to a single endpoint for simplicity. Mark, the Security Officer, has proposed publishing events to a system topic and creating an event subscription for each customer.

Does this solution meet all the requirements for the Event Grid implementation?
