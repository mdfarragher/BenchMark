      title: "Yes, Durable Functions async pattern solves HTTP timeout issues"
      correct: false
      explain: "While the Durable Functions async pattern is excellent for long-running operations, the problem states the function uses an output binding (not input binding) and is triggered by HTTP. The issue is that the function is being triggered using the wrong mechanism. Blob triggers or Event Grid triggers would be more appropriate for processing blob data than HTTP triggers with output bindings."

      title: "No, change the trigger type to blob trigger or Event Grid trigger"
      correct: true
      explain: "The function should use a blob trigger or Event Grid blob trigger instead of an HTTP trigger with an output binding. HTTP-triggered functions in the Consumption plan have a maximum response time of 230 seconds due to load balancer constraints. Blob triggers are designed specifically for processing blob data and don't have this limitation, making them the proper solution for blob data processing."

You work as a Serverless Developer for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that provides certification courses to students globally. Mark, the Backend Services Manager, has deployed an HTTP-triggered Azure Function app to process student assignment submissions stored as blobs in Azure Storage. When students upload their project files, presentations, or code assignments, the function is triggered via HTTP request with an output binding configuration pointing to the blob storage location. The function analyzes the submitted files, checks them for plagiarism, validates file formats, generates feedback reports, and updates the student's grade record. However, the processing continues to time out after four minutes (240 seconds), preventing students from receiving timely feedback on their submissions. The function must reliably process all blob data regardless of file size or processing complexity. Claire, the Development Lead, has suggested using the Durable Functions async pattern to handle the long-running blob processing tasks.

Does this solution adequately address the timeout problem for processing blob data?
