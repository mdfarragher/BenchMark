answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "URL to download the SDK from"
      correct: false
      explain: "The URL to download the SDK is specified in the src attribute of the script element, not in the cfg object. The cfg object contains configuration settings that control how the SDK behaves, including where to send telemetry data, not where to download the SDK code from."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Application Insights connection string"
      correct: true
      explain: "The cfg object must contain the Application Insights connection string, which tells the SDK where to send the collected telemetry data. The connection string includes the instrumentation key and endpoints needed to transmit monitoring data to your specific Application Insights resource in Azure."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "appId used to correlate AJAX dependencies on the client-side with the server-side requests"
      correct: false
      explain: "While the appId can be part of the Application Insights configuration for correlation purposes, it's not the primary required value for the cfg object. The connection string is the essential configuration that enables the SDK to send data to Application Insights. The appId is typically derived from the connection string automatically."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "crossOrigin attribute designating support for cross-origin resource sharing"
      correct: false
      explain: "The crossOrigin setting is an attribute on the script element itself, not a value within the cfg configuration object. The cfg object is specifically for Application Insights settings like the connection string, sampling configuration, and instrumentation options."

You work as a Frontend Developer for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that delivers certification courses to students worldwide. Mark, the Analytics Lead, has tasked you with implementing client-side Real User Monitoring (RUM) for the Student Learning Portal using the Application Insights JavaScript SDK. 

The portal is hosted on on-premises web servers and serves pages for course browsing, quiz taking, video streaming, and certificate downloads. You need to track user interactions, page performance, and JavaScript errors across all pages. After adding the script element to each page with the **src** attribute pointing to the CDN-hosted SDK file, you now need to configure the **cfg** object.

What should you set for the value of the **cfg** key in the script element of each page?
