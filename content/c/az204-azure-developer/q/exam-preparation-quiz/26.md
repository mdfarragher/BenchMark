title: "Select Hosting Plan for Function App"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Shared"
      correct: false
      explain: "Azure Functions cannot run on Shared hosting plans. Shared plans are designed for basic web apps and don't provide the infrastructure needed for Azure Functions, including event-driven scaling, long-running execution support, or the necessary runtime environment."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Consumption"
      correct: true
      explain: "The Consumption plan provides event-driven autoscaling and can scale to 200 instances, which meets the max concurrency requirement for this scenario. It also supports a maximum execution timeout of 10 minutes, which covers the 1–10 minute processing window for the workload. For these reasons Consumption satisfies the timeout and scaling requirements for App1."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Premium"
      correct: false
      explain: "The Premium plan provides features like longer execution durations and advanced scaling controls, and is suitable for scenarios that require reserved instances or VNET integration. However, its typical documented upper scaling guidance is around 100 instances, which is less than the Consumption plan provides (200 instances)."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Dedicated"
      correct: false
      explain: "While Dedicated plans support long-running functions and custom timeout configurations, they don't provide true event-driven autoscaling like Consumption or Premium. Dedicated plans use manual or scheduled scaling and therefore do not meet the event-driven autoscaling requirement for peak exam periods."

You work as a Serverless Architecture Designer for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that delivers certification courses to students globally. Mark, the Cloud Operations Director, has asked you to design two Azure Function apps to process student assessment data. 

- **App1** is Windows-based and will be deployed as compiled C# code to handle exam grading and score calculations. 
- **App2** is Linux-based and will be deployed as a custom container image to run specialized plagiarism detection algorithms. 

Performance analysis shows that both apps will process requests that take between 1 and 10 minutes to complete, depending on the complexity of the assessment and the number of submissions being processed. 

The Azure Function apps must support these long-running operations without timing out, provide event-driven autoscaling so that resources scale up during peak exam periods (when hundreds of students submit simultaneously) and scale down during quiet periods, and maximize the upper scaling limit to handle the largest possible number of concurrent student submissions during final exam seasons.

Which hosting plan should you choose for **App1** (the Windows-based code deployment)?
