title: "Select Hosting Plan for Linux Container Function App"
type: "question"

answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Shared"
      correct: false
      explain: "Azure Functions cannot run on Shared hosting plans, and Shared plans definitely don't support Linux containers. Shared hosting is designed for basic web apps only and lacks the infrastructure for containerized workloads or Azure Functions runtime support."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Consumption"
      correct: false
      explain: "The standard Consumption plan doesn't support custom Linux containers—it only supports code deployments. Additionally, even if it did, the 10-minute maximum timeout would be insufficient for the 1-10 minute processing requirement. The Flex Consumption plan supports containers but may have different scaling characteristics."

      title: "Premium"
      correct: true
      explain: "The Premium plan supports Linux custom containers, provides unbounded execution duration that can handle the 1-10 minute processing window, offers event-driven autoscaling through KEDA, and provides high upper scaling limits. This makes it ideal for containerized workloads requiring long execution times and dynamic scaling."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Dedicated"
      correct: false
      explain: "While Dedicated (App Service) plans do support Linux containers and allow custom timeout configurations, they don't provide true event-driven autoscaling. Dedicated plans rely on manual or scheduled scaling rules rather than automatic event-driven scaling, which doesn't meet the requirement for autoscaling behavior that responds to events."

You work as a Serverless Architecture Designer for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that delivers certification courses to students globally. Claire, the Platform Engineering Manager, has asked you to design two Azure Function apps to process student assessment data. App1 is Windows-based and will be deployed as compiled C# code to handle exam grading and score calculations. App2 is Linux-based and will be deployed as a custom container image that runs specialized plagiarism detection algorithms with specific Python library dependencies and custom ML models. Performance testing indicates that both apps will process requests taking between 1 and 10 minutes to complete, depending on the assessment complexity and submission volume. The solution must support these long-running operations without timing out, provide event-driven autoscaling that automatically increases capacity during peak exam periods (when hundreds of students submit assessments simultaneously) and decreases during off-peak hours, and maximize the upper scaling limit to accommodate the highest possible number of concurrent student submissions during finals week.

Which hosting plan should you choose for App2 (the Linux-based container deployment)?
