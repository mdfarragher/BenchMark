      title: "Yes, the minimum throughput is 400 RUs"
      correct: false
      explain: "With autoscale configured at 5000 RU/s maximum, the system scales between 10% of max (500 RU/s) and the maximum (5000 RU/s). The minimum throughput is calculated as 0.1 × Tmax, which equals 500 RU/s, not 400 RU/s. The 400 RU/s value was associated with older manual provisioning minimums."

      title: "No, the minimum throughput is 500 RUs"
      correct: true
      explain: "Autoscale throughput automatically scales between 10% of the maximum (Tmax) and the maximum value. With -AutoscaleMaxThroughput set to 5000, the minimum is 0.1 × 5000 = 500 RU/s. Azure Cosmos DB will automatically scale the container between 500 and 5000 RU/s based on actual workload demands."

You work as a Database Developer for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that delivers certification courses to students worldwide. Mark, the Data Platform Manager, has asked you to provision an Azure Cosmos DB container to store student enrollment records for a new web application. The application experiences variable load patterns—high traffic during course registration periods and exam seasons, but lower usage during holidays and off-peak hours. To optimize costs while maintaining performance, Mark decided to configure autoscale throughput instead of manual provisioning. You've created the container using PowerShell with the following configuration:

```powershell
$resourceGroupName = "StudentResourceGroup"
$accountName = "MDFTProCosmosAccount"
$databaseName = "EnrollmentDatabase"
$containerName = "StudentEnrollments"
$partitionKeyPath = "/StudentId"
$autoscaleMaxThroughput = 5000
New-AzCosmosDBSqlContainer
	-ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName
	-AccountName $accountName
	-DatabaseName $databaseName
	-Name $containerName
	-PartitionKeyKind Hash
	-PartitionKeyPath $partitionKeyPath
	-AutoscaleMaxThroughput $autoscaleMaxThroughput
```

Is the following statement about the container configuration true?

**Statement:** The minimum throughput for the container is 400 RUs.
