title: "Copy Blobs Between Containers"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Download the blob to a virtual machine and then upload the blob to CourseArchive"
      correct: false
      explain: "This approach introduces unnecessary latency and resource consumption by requiring two separate operations (download and upload) through a VM intermediary. It's inefficient for real-time copying and increases costs due to VM compute time and egress charges."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Run the Azure PowerShell command 'Start-AzStorageBlobCopy'"
      correct: true
      explain: "This PowerShell cmdlet performs server-side asynchronous blob copies directly between containers without downloading to an intermediate location. It's efficient for real-time copying, supports copying specific blobs based on requirements, and can exclude backup copies through selective blob selection."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Copy blobs to CourseArchive by using the PUT Blob operation of the Blob Service REST API"
      correct: false
      explain: "The PUT Blob operation is designed to create or update blobs from local content, not to copy between containers. This would require downloading the blob content first and then uploading it, which is inefficient compared to server-side copy operations."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Use AzCopy with the '-Snapshot' switch to copy blobs to CourseArchive"
      correct: false
      explain: "While AzCopy is useful for blob operations, using the Snapshot switch would copy blob snapshots, which are backup-related artifacts. The requirement specifically excludes backup blob copies, making this approach unsuitable for the scenario."

You work as a Cloud Developer for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that provides online courses to students worldwide. Mark, the Infrastructure Manager, has deployed an application that allows trainers to upload course videos and presentation materials to Azure Blob Storage. The application uses the Storage REST API to upload media files to a blob storage account named **CourseStorage**. 

The storage account has two containers: **CourseLibrary** for active course content and **CourseArchive** for completed courses. Video uploads from trainers occur irregularly throughout the semester, and you need to automatically copy specific course videos from **CourseLibrary** to **CourseArchive** when courses are marked as complete, while ensuring that backup blob copies are excluded from the transfer process.

What should you do to implement blob copying between the containers?
