title: "Configure Container Apps Health Probe for Readiness"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "HTTP liveness probe"
      correct: false
      explain: "Liveness probes determine if a container is running properly and should be restarted if it fails. While important for maintaining container health, liveness probes don't validate that the application is ready to handle incoming web requests—they only check if the process should be restarted."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "TCP readiness probe"
      correct: false
      explain: "While TCP readiness probes can check if a port is open, they only verify network connectivity and don't validate that the application is fully initialized and ready to process web requests properly. For web applications, HTTP readiness probes provide more comprehensive validation of application readiness."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "HTTP startup probe"
      correct: false
      explain: "Startup probes are used for containers with slow initialization, giving them more time to start before liveness checks begin. Once the startup probe succeeds, liveness and readiness probes take over. Startup probes don't continuously validate that the application is ready to handle requests."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "TCP liveness probe"
      correct: false
      explain: "TCP liveness probes check if a container's port is accepting connections to determine if it should be restarted. However, they don't validate readiness to handle requests, and using TCP doesn't verify that the HTTP application logic is properly initialized and ready to process web requests."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "HTTP readiness probe"
      correct: true
      explain: "HTTP readiness probes validate that a container is ready to accept and properly handle incoming web requests. They send HTTP GET requests to a specified endpoint and check for successful responses. Container Apps won't route traffic to replicas that fail readiness probes, ensuring only fully initialized replicas receive requests."

You work as a Microservices Reliability Engineer for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that delivers certification courses to students worldwide. Claire, the DevOps Lead, has tasked you with deploying a microservices-based Student Order Processing application using Azure Container Apps. The application consists of several containerized services including order processing, inventory management for course materials, and report generation for student transcripts. You've just deployed a new revision of the order processing service that handles incoming web requests from students enrolling in courses and purchasing certification exam vouchers. The service must be triggered by HTTP requests and needs to be continuously available to handle student orders. However, during deployment testing, you notice that new container replicas sometimes receive traffic before they're fully initialized—causing failed orders and error messages for students. The startup process includes loading course catalog data, establishing database connections, and warming up caches, which takes 15-30 seconds. You need to implement a health check that ensures replicas only receive production traffic after they're fully ready to handle incoming web requests.

What type of health probe should you implement to validate that replicas are ready to handle incoming requests?
