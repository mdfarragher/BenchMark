title: "Share Session Token Between Application Nodes"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Feed options"
      correct: false
      explain: "FeedOptions (or QueryRequestOptions) are used to configure query operations like setting partition keys, max item counts, or continuation tokens. They don't provide session token management capabilities needed for sharing session consistency across multiple application nodes."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Request options"
      correct: false
      explain: "RequestOptions configure individual operations but don't provide a mechanism to extract and share session tokens between nodes. While you can set a session token in request options, you need to first obtain it from a response object, not from request options themselves."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Connection policy"
      correct: false
      explain: "ConnectionPolicy (or CosmosClientOptions) configures client-level settings like connection mode, retry policies, and timeouts. It manages how the client connects to Cosmos DB but doesn't handle session token extraction or sharing between application nodes."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Document response"
      correct: true
      explain: "The DocumentResponse (or ItemResponse/ResourceResponse) object contains the SessionToken property that can be extracted after read or write operations. This token can be shared with other nodes and passed in subsequent requests via RequestOptions.SessionToken, ensuring all nodes participate in the same session for session consistency."

You work as a Distributed Systems Developer for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that delivers certification courses to students worldwide. Mark, the Data Architecture Lead, has deployed an Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL API account named **StudentDataAccount** that contains a database **LearningDB** with a container **EnrollmentRecords**. The account is configured with session consistency level to balance performance and consistency. You're developing a Student Enrollment Portal application that will be deployed across multiple nodes for high availability and load balancing. Each node instance must perform both read and write operations to the enrollment records container. To maintain session consistency across all nodes—ensuring that after a student updates their enrollment, all nodes can immediately read the updated data—the application must share session tokens between nodes so they all participate in the same logical session.

Which Cosmos DB SDK object should you use to extract and share the session token between application nodes?
