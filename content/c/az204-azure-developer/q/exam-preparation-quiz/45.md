      title: "AddAzureAppConfiguration"
      correct: true
      explain: "AddAzureAppConfiguration is the required method to connect your ASP.NET Core application to Azure App Configuration. It configures the configuration provider to read settings and feature flags from the App Configuration store. This method must be called in Program.cs or Startup.cs to enable the application to access feature flags defined in Azure."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "AddControllersWithViews"
      correct: false
      explain: "AddControllersWithViews registers MVC controllers and view services for the application. While necessary for an ASP.NET Core MVC app, it has nothing to do with connecting to Azure App Configuration or enabling feature flag functionality. This is for MVC infrastructure, not configuration management."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "AddUserSecrets"
      correct: false
      explain: "AddUserSecrets enables the Secret Manager tool for storing sensitive configuration locally during development. While useful for connection strings, it's for local development secrets, not for connecting to Azure App Configuration service. User Secrets don't provide feature flag management or remote configuration capabilities."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "AddFeatureFlags"
      correct: false
      explain: "While there is feature flag configuration within the App Configuration setup, AddFeatureFlags is not the primary startup method. You first need AddAzureAppConfiguration to establish the connection, then configure feature flags within that context. The proper pattern uses UseFeatureFlags() within the AddAzureAppConfiguration configuration."

You work as a Configuration Management Specialist for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that delivers certification courses to students worldwide. Mark, the DevOps Lead, has asked you to integrate Azure App Configuration into the Student Learning Portal ASP.NET Core application to enable centralized feature flag management. You've created an App Configuration store named **AppFeatureFlagStore** with a feature flag called "Export" that controls the data export functionality. The feature flag is currently set to "Off" for testing before production rollout. Now you need to configure the application's startup code to connect to Azure App Configuration so the application can read feature flags and other configuration settings at runtime.

| Property      | Value                  |
| ------------- | ---------------------- |
| Key           | Export                 |
| Label         | Export                 |
| State         | Off                    |
| Description   | Ability to export data |

The view markup uses the feature tag helper:

```xml
<feature name="export">
	<li class="nav-item">
		<a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-area="" asp-controller="home" asp-action="export">Export Data</a>
	</li>
</feature>
```

Which startup method should you use to connect the application to Azure App Configuration?
