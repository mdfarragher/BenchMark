    - id: "answer1"
      title: "https://appfeatureflagstore.azconfig.io"
      correct: true
      explain: "Azure App Configuration endpoints use the format https://{store-name}.azconfig.io. Since the store is named 'AppFeatureFlagStore', the endpoint is https://appfeatureflagstore.azconfig.io. This endpoint URL is used by the application to connect to the App Configuration service and retrieve feature flags and configuration values."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "https://appfeatureflagstore.vault.azure.net"
      correct: false
      explain: "The vault.azure.net domain is used for Azure Key Vault endpoints, not App Configuration. While Key Vault stores secrets and certificates, App Configuration manages application settings and feature flags. These are different services with different endpoint patterns."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "https://export.azconfig.io"
      correct: false
      explain: "The endpoint must be based on the App Configuration store name (AppFeatureFlagStore), not the feature flag name (Export). Feature flags are stored within an App Configuration store, so the endpoint references the store name, not individual flag names."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "https://export.vault.azure.net"
      correct: false
      explain: "This combines two errors: using the Key Vault domain (vault.azure.net) instead of App Configuration (azconfig.io), and using the feature flag name (export) instead of the store name (appfeatureflagstore). The correct endpoint must reference the App Configuration store name with the azconfig.io domain."

You work as a Cloud Configuration Engineer for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that delivers certification courses to students worldwide. Claire, the Application Architecture Lead, has tasked you with completing the Azure App Configuration integration for the Student Learning Portal. You've created an App Configuration store named **AppFeatureFlagStore** to centrally manage feature flags including the "Export" feature that controls data export functionality. The application code is ready to connect to App Configuration using the AddAzureAppConfiguration method, but you need to specify the correct endpoint URL in the application's configuration settings. The endpoint setting tells the application where to connect to retrieve feature flags and other configuration data.

| Property      | Value                  |
| ------------- | ---------------------- |
| Key           | Export                 |
| Label         | Export                 |
| State         | Off                    |
| Description   | Ability to export data |

The view markup uses the feature tag helper:

```xml
<feature name="export">
	<li class="nav-item">
		<a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-area="" asp-controller="home" asp-action="export">Export Data</a>
	</li>
</feature>
```

Which AppConfig endpoint setting should you configure in the application?
