title: "Enable Rust Language Support in Azure Functions"

      title: "Custom handler"
      correct: true
      explain: "Custom handlers enable Azure Functions to support any language or runtime that can respond to HTTP requests. For languages not natively supported like Rust, Go, or other compiled languages, custom handlers act as a lightweight web server that receives events from the Functions host and translates them for your code, allowing developers to write functions in Rust while leveraging the Azure Functions platform."

      title: "Extension bundle"
      correct: false
      explain: "Extension bundles provide pre-packaged binding extensions for triggers and input/output bindings (like Blob, Queue, CosmosDB). They don't add language runtime support. Extension bundles are about adding connectivity to Azure services, not enabling new programming languages."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Trigger"
      correct: false
      explain: "Triggers define how functions are invoked (HTTP, Timer, Queue, etc.) but don't determine which programming languages can be used. Triggers are about activation mechanisms, not language support. You can use the same triggers regardless of whether you're writing in C#, JavaScript, Python, or Rust."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Runtime"
      correct: false
      explain: "Runtime refers to the built-in language runtimes that Azure Functions natively supports (like .NET, Node.js, Python, Java). Since Rust isn't a natively supported runtime, you can't simply select it. Instead, you need custom handlers to bridge between the Functions host and Rust code."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "Policy"
      correct: false
      explain: "Policy in Azure Functions context typically refers to access policies or configuration settings, not language support. Policies control security, permissions, and operational behavior but have no bearing on which programming languages developers can use to write function code."
    - id: "answer6"
      title: "Hosting plan"
      correct: false
      explain: "Hosting plans (Consumption, Premium, Dedicated) determine the infrastructure and scaling behavior for function apps. The choice of hosting plan doesn't affect which programming languages are supported—language support is determined by runtime and custom handler capabilities, not the hosting model."

You work as a Platform Engineering Specialist for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that delivers certification courses to students worldwide. Claire, the Development Innovation Manager, wants to enable the development team to write Azure Functions using the Rust programming language for performance-critical operations like processing student exam scores, calculating complex certification requirements, and generating encrypted certificates. Rust offers memory safety and high performance, making it ideal for these computationally intensive tasks. However, Rust is not one of the natively supported languages in Azure Functions (which include C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, and PowerShell). You need to implement a solution that allows developers to write and deploy Rust-based functions while still leveraging the Azure Functions platform's triggers, bindings, and scaling capabilities.

Which Azure Function app feature should you use to enable developers to write functions using the Rust language?
