title: "Declaratively Connect to Azure Blob Storage"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Custom handler"
      correct: false
      explain: "Custom handlers enable support for non-native languages by providing an HTTP bridge between the Functions host and your code. While you could manually implement blob access in a custom handler, this requires writing imperative code to connect to storage rather than using Azure Functions' declarative binding system."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Extension bundle"
      correct: false
      explain: "Extension bundles package binding extensions together for easy installation, making them available to your function app. While necessary for blob bindings to work, the bundle itself doesn't provide the declarative connection—it just makes the binding types available. You still need to declare the actual binding in your function."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Trigger"
      correct: true
      explain: "Triggers and bindings (including blob triggers and blob input/output bindings) provide declarative connections to Azure services. By adding binding attributes like [BlobTrigger] or [Blob] to function parameters, you declaratively specify the connection without writing imperative code to create clients, authenticate, or manage connections. The Functions runtime handles all the plumbing automatically."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Runtime"
      correct: false
      explain: "The runtime provides the execution environment for your chosen language (.NET, Node.js, Python, etc.) but doesn't specifically provide declarative connections to Azure services. While the runtime enables your code to execute, the declarative connection capability comes from the triggers and bindings system, not the runtime itself."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "Policy"
      correct: false
      explain: "Policies in Azure Functions relate to configuration, security, and governance settings. They don't provide mechanisms for connecting to Azure Storage or other services. Policies control behavior and access, not service connectivity."
    - id: "answer6"
      title: "Hosting plan"
      correct: false
      explain: "Hosting plans determine where and how your functions run (Consumption, Premium, Dedicated) but don't affect how functions connect to services. The declarative binding system works the same way regardless of which hosting plan you choose."

You work as a Serverless Architecture Designer for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that delivers certification courses to students worldwide. Mark, the Cloud Development Lead, is standardizing how Azure Function apps connect to Azure services to reduce boilerplate code and improve maintainability. The development team frequently builds functions that need to read and write blobs in Azure Blob Storage—processing student assignment uploads, generating certificate PDFs, and storing course materials. Rather than writing imperative code with Storage SDK clients, connection strings, authentication logic, and error handling in every function, Mark wants developers to use Azure Functions' declarative approach where they simply specify parameters with attributes, and the runtime handles all the connection details automatically.

Which Azure Function app feature should you use to enable developers to declaratively connect to Azure Blob Storage accounts without writing explicit connection code?
