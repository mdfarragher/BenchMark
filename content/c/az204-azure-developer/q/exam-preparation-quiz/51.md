title: "Select Event Grid Topic Type for Customer Events"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Custom topic"
      correct: true
      explain: "Custom topics allow you to publish events to a single endpoint and create multiple event subscriptions for different customers. Custom topics support Microsoft Entra ID authentication and authorization, enabling secure access control. Each subscription can filter events by event type using advanced filters, allowing thousands of customers to receive only the events they need. Custom topics are designed for exactly this scenario—publishing application-generated events to multiple subscribers with granular filtering."

      title: "Partner topic"
      correct: false
      explain: "Partner topics are designed for receiving events from external SaaS providers like Auth0, SendGrid, or Microsoft Graph, not for publishing your own application events to customers. Partner topics are created when customers authorize a partner to send them events. Since you're publishing events from your own application to customers (not receiving events from a third-party partner), partner topics are not the appropriate solution."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "System topic"
      correct: false
      explain: "System topics are automatically created for Azure service events like Blob Storage changes, Resource Manager operations, or IoT Hub telemetry. They represent events from Azure platform services, not custom application events. Since you're publishing application-generated events about your training platform activities, system topics don't apply to this scenario."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Domain"
      correct: false
      explain: "Event Grid domains provide a way to manage thousands of topics under a single resource for multi-tenant scenarios where each tenant gets their own topic. However, domains create separate topics per tenant rather than a single endpoint with filtered subscriptions. Custom topics with filtered subscriptions are simpler and more appropriate when you need one endpoint with subscription-level filtering by event type."

You work as an Event-Driven Architecture Specialist for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that delivers certification courses to students worldwide. Mark, the Platform Integration Lead, is building a real-time notification system that pushes near-real-time information about course updates, exam results, certification achievements, and enrollment changes to thousands of customers including students, instructors, and corporate partners. The system must publish hundreds of different event types such as "CoursePublished", "ExamCompleted", "CertificateIssued", and "EnrollmentConfirmed". Each customer should receive only the event types relevant to them—for example, instructors need course and exam events while corporate partners need enrollment and certification events. All authentication and authorization must use Microsoft Entra ID for secure access control, and the solution must publish all events to a single endpoint while allowing customers to filter by event type before processing.

Which type of Azure Event Grid resource should you create to meet these requirements?
