      title: "1,100"
      correct: false
      explain: "This would be the sum of restaurant locations (1,000) plus menu items (500) divided by 2. However, logical partitions are created based on unique partition key values, not the sum of different entity types. Since the partition key is 'location id' and there are 1,000 unique restaurant locations, the container will have 1,000 logical partitions, not 1,100."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "10,000,000"
      correct: false
      explain: "This appears to be derived from the 10,000 RUs multiplied by 1,000, but logical partition count has no relationship to provisioned throughput (RUs). Logical partitions are created based solely on the number of unique partition key values. Request Units affect physical partition allocation and performance, not logical partition creation."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "10,000"
      correct: false
      explain: "This matches the number of staff members stored in the container. However, logical partitions are determined by unique partition key values, not by the total number of documents or any specific entity type count. Since 'location id' is the partition key and there are 1,000 restaurant locations, the container creates 1,000 logical partitions regardless of how many staff, menu items, or other documents exist."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "1,000"
      correct: true
      explain: "Logical partitions in Cosmos DB are created based on unique partition key values. Since the partition key is 'location id' and the container stores information for 1,000 restaurant locations, there will be exactly 1,000 logical partitions—one for each unique location id. Each logical partition can contain all related data for that location (menu items and staff) up to the 20 GB limit per logical partition."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "500"
      correct: false
      explain: "This matches the number of menu items stored in the container. However, logical partitions are not based on the count of any particular entity type but on the number of unique partition key values. Since the partition key is 'location id' with 1,000 unique restaurant locations, the container will have 1,000 logical partitions, not 500."

You work as a NoSQL Database Architect for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that delivers certification courses to students worldwide. Mark, the Learning Platform Data Lead, has deployed an Azure Cosmos DB instance with Strong consistency level and 10,000 Request Units (RUs) per container to support a hands-on restaurant management training application. Geo-replication is enabled for global availability. The container stores restaurant information for the training scenarios including location data, menu items, and staff records. Currently, the system contains information for 1,000 restaurant locations, 500 menu items per location, and 10,000 staff members distributed across all locations. When designing the container, you selected 'location id' as the partition key to ensure all data for a specific restaurant location is co-located for efficient queries.

How many logical partitions will be created for the container?
