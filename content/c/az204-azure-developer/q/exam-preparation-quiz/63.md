title: "Run Pre-Deployment Script for Static Content"
type: "question"
layout: "multiple"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Create a file named .deployment in the root of the repository that calls a script which generates the static content and deploys the website"
      correct: true
      explain: "The .deployment file in the repository root allows you to customize the Kudu deployment process by specifying a custom deployment script. You can create a .deployment file that references a custom script (like deploy.cmd or deploy.sh) which generates static content before the standard deployment steps execute. This is the recommended approach for customizing Azure Web App continuous deployments from GitHub."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Add a PreBuild target in the website's csproj project file that runs the static content generation script"
      correct: true
      explain: "MSBuild PreBuild targets execute before the build process begins. When Azure App Service performs continuous deployment, it runs the build process for .NET applications, including any PreBuild targets defined in the .csproj file. Adding a PreBuild target that generates static content ensures the script runs automatically before compilation and deployment, integrating seamlessly with the standard build and deployment workflow."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Create a file named run.cmd in the folder /run that calls a script which generates the static content and deploys the website"
      correct: false
      explain: "There is no /run folder convention in Azure App Service deployment architecture. Azure App Service uses Kudu for deployments, which recognizes .deployment files in the repository root and custom deployment scripts, but not a /run/run.cmd pattern. This approach would not be executed during the continuous deployment process."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Add the path to the static content generation tool to WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE setting in the host.json file"
      correct: false
      explain: "WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE is an App Service application setting (not a host.json setting) used to run the app from a deployment package ZIP file for improved performance. It doesn't execute scripts or generate content—it simply changes how the deployed application runs. Additionally, host.json is specific to Azure Functions, not ASP.NET Core web apps. This approach wouldn't generate static content during deployment."

You work as a DevOps Engineer for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that delivers certification courses to students worldwide. Claire, the Web Platform Lead, is preparing to deploy an ASP.NET Core website for the Student Learning Portal to an Azure Web App using continuous deployment from a GitHub repository. The website includes static content such as course thumbnails, certification badge images, and pre-rendered course catalogs that are generated by a Node.js script during the build process. The continuous deployment feature automatically deploys code changes from GitHub, but you need to ensure the static content generation script runs successfully before the website starts serving traffic to students and instructors.

What are two possible ways to achieve this goal?
