      title: "Create a single Service Bus Namespace → Create a single Service Bus topic → Create a single Service Bus subscription"
      correct: false
      explain: "While creating a single namespace is correct, using a single topic and single subscription doesn't support the filtering requirements. With one topic and one subscription, all trainers would receive all course assignments regardless of which courses they selected. The system needs topic-level or subscription-level filtering to ensure trainers only see assignments for their selected courses."

      title: "Create a single Service Bus Namespace → Create a Service Bus topic for each course → Create a Service Bus subscription for each trainer"
      correct: false
      explain: "Creating a topic per course would work for segregating assignments by course, but creating a subscription for each trainer (rather than per course per trainer) doesn't properly model the workflow. A trainer might select multiple courses, requiring multiple subscriptions. The correct pattern is one topic per course with one subscription per trainer for that specific course, ensuring proper isolation and competitive consumption."

      title: "Create a single Service Bus Namespace → Create a Service Bus topic for each course → Create a Service Bus subscription for each course for each trainer"
      correct: true
      explain: "This is the correct architecture: one namespace organizes all resources, one topic per course allows publishing course-specific assignments, and one subscription per trainer per course ensures each trainer receives only assignments for courses they've selected. When a trainer accepts an assignment, they receive and delete the message from their subscription, removing it from availability using Service Bus's competitive consumer pattern. Other trainers' subscriptions for that course retain their copies until someone accepts."

      title: "Create a Service Bus Namespace for each course → Create a single Service Bus topic → Create a Service Bus subscription for each trainer"
      correct: false
      explain: "Creating a separate namespace for each course is unnecessary overhead and increases management complexity. Service Bus namespaces are designed to contain multiple topics and subscriptions. A single namespace with multiple topics (one per course) is the standard and cost-effective pattern, as namespaces provide logical containers for related messaging entities."

You work as a Cloud Messaging Architect for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that delivers certification courses to students worldwide. Mark, the Learning Operations Manager, is developing a mobile app for the Course Assignment System that trainers use to select which courses they want to teach. The workflow operates as follows: (1) a trainer selects specific courses they're qualified to teach (such as "AZ-104", "AZ-204", "AZ-305"), (2) when students request courses, assignment notifications are sent to all available trainers in a region, (3) only assignments for the courses the trainer selected will appear in their app, and (4) the first trainer to accept a course assignment removes it from the list of available assignments for all other trainers, ensuring no duplicate course scheduling. You need to implement this competitive consumer pattern using Azure Service Bus.

Which three actions should you perform in sequence to implement the Service Bus solution?
