      title: "Yes, publishing to a custom topic with subscriptions per customer meets all requirements"
      correct: false
      explain: "While custom topics support Microsoft Entra ID authentication and allow creating event subscriptions with filtering by event type, creating one subscription per customer for thousands of customers is operationally impractical. Managing thousands of individual subscriptions creates significant administrative overhead, complicates deployment automation, and makes it difficult to scale as new customers are added. A better approach would use a single endpoint per customer with application-level filtering or Event Grid domains for multi-tenant scenarios."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "No, this solution does not meet the goal"
      correct: true
      explain: "Although custom topics technically support the requirements (single endpoint, Entra ID authentication, event filtering), creating one subscription per customer for thousands of customers is not a scalable or practical solution. Event subscriptions are designed for routing to different endpoints or applying different processing logic, not for per-customer isolation at massive scale. For thousands of customers, you should consider Event Grid domains (multi-tenant) or a single subscription per customer endpoint with application-level filtering."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "No, custom topics do not support Microsoft Entra ID authentication"
      correct: false
      explain: "Custom topics fully support Microsoft Entra ID authentication for publishing events. You can use Azure RBAC with the Event Grid Data Sender role to control who can publish events to the topic. The issue with this solution is not authentication support but the scalability and manageability of creating thousands of subscriptions."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "No, custom topics do not support filtering by event type"
      correct: false
      explain: "Custom topics fully support advanced filtering on event subscriptions, including filtering by event type using the 'type' system property. Each subscription can have filters that select only specific event types. The problem with this solution is not filtering capability but the operational complexity of managing thousands of individual subscriptions."

You work as an Event-Driven Architecture Specialist for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that delivers certification courses to students worldwide. Claire, the Platform Integration Lead, is implementing a real-time notification system using Azure Event Grid to push near-real-time information about course updates, exam results, certification achievements, and enrollment changes to thousands of customers including students, instructors, and corporate partners. The system must publish hundreds of different event types such as "CoursePublished", "ExamCompleted", "CertificateIssued", and "EnrollmentConfirmed". The solution requires filtering events by event type before processing (students receive different events than instructors), Microsoft Entra ID must handle all authentication and authorization, and all events must be published to a single endpoint for simplified publishing logic.

You need to implement an Event Grid solution.

**Solution:** Publish events to a custom topic. Create an event subscription for each customer.

Does the solution meet the requirements?
