title: "Implement Transient Error Retry Logic"

      title: "Disable connection pooling and configure a second Azure Database for MySQL instance"
      correct: false
      explain: "Disabling connection pooling would worsen the problem by forcing the application to create new connections for every request, increasing overhead and likelihood of connection failures. Connection pooling actually helps by reusing connections. Additionally, adding a second MySQL instance doesn't address transient connection errors—you need retry logic to handle temporary failures, not redundant infrastructure."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Close the database connection and immediately report an error"
      correct: false
      explain: "Immediately reporting errors without retry attempts defeats the purpose of transient fault handling. Transient errors are temporary conditions that often resolve within seconds. Best practices recommend waiting and retrying rather than immediately failing. Closing the connection is correct, but you should retry with a fresh connection after a delay, not report the error immediately."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Wait five seconds before repeating the connection attempt to the database"
      correct: true
      explain: "Waiting before retrying is a core component of transient fault handling. Microsoft recommends waiting at least 5 seconds before the first retry to avoid overwhelming the service during reconfiguration. This initial delay gives the database time to complete any ongoing maintenance or load balancing operations that caused the transient error."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Increase connection repeat attempts exponentially up to 120 seconds"
      correct: true
      explain: "Exponential backoff is the recommended retry strategy for Azure databases. After the initial 5-second wait, each subsequent retry should wait exponentially longer (e.g., 5s, 10s, 20s, 40s, 80s) up to a maximum of 60-120 seconds. This prevents overwhelming the database during longer outages while giving transient conditions time to resolve. The exponential increase reduces load while maximizing the chance of successful reconnection."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "Set a maximum number of connection attempts to 10 and report an error on subsequent connections"
      correct: true
      explain: "Setting a maximum retry count prevents infinite retry loops and allows the application to fail gracefully when errors are not transient. After exhausting retries (typically 5-10 attempts), the application should report the error rather than continuing indefinitely. This ensures the application doesn't hang forever and can inform users or administrators about persistent connection problems."

You work as a Database Reliability Engineer for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that delivers certification courses to students worldwide. Claire, the Application Development Manager, has deployed an ASP.NET Core application for the Student Enrollment Portal that connects to an Azure Database for MySQL instance to store course registrations, student profiles, and enrollment history. Users report that database connections appear to drop intermittently—the application shows connection errors for a few seconds, then starts working again. After investigating, you determine these are transient connection errors caused by Azure's normal load balancing and maintenance operations. The current application code does not handle connection failures gracefully and immediately shows errors to users instead of retrying. You need to implement proper retry logic in the code to handle these transient connection errors.

What are three practices you should implement as part of the transient error handling solution?
