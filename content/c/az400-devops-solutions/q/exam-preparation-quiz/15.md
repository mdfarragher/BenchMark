You work at MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, where you maintain a Node.js application. During a security audit using WhiteSource Bolt, the scan identifies several libraries with invalid licenses. Upon investigation, you determine that these libraries are only used during development and not needed in production.

You need to configure the npm tool to only install the production dependencies for scanning, excluding development dependencies.

Which npm command should you run to ensure only production dependencies are installed?
