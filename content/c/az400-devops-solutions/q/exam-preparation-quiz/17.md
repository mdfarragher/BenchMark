MDFT Academy hosts a web application in Azure for their online training platform and makes use of Azure Pipelines for managing the build and release of the application.

When stakeholders report that system performance has been adversely affected by the most recent releases, you configure alerts in Azure Monitor. You are informed that new releases must satisfy specified performance baseline conditions in the staging environment before they can be deployed to production.

You need to make sure that releases not satisfying the performance baseline are prevented from being deployed.

What should you add to the pipeline?
