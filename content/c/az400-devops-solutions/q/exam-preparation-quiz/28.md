      title: "git checkout main-3 -- App.exe.config"
      explain: "The notation 'main-3' is incorrect for Git refspecs. The tilde (~) symbol, not hyphen (-), is used to refer to ancestors in Git."

      title: "git revert main~3 App.exe.config"
      explain: "The 'git revert' command is used to create a new commit that undoes changes from a previous commit, not to restore a specific file from a previous revision without creating a new commit."

      title: "git revert main-3 App.exe.config"
      explain: "This answer contains two errors: First, 'git revert' is not the appropriate command to restore a specific file version. Second, the notation 'main-3' is incorrect for Git refspecs; the tilde (~) symbol should be used instead of a hyphen."

You work at MDFT Academy, which uses Git for source control. You are maintaining an application named TrainerPortal. In the main branch, you need to restore the third most recent revision of a file named App.exe.config.

What is the correct Git command to accomplish this goal?
