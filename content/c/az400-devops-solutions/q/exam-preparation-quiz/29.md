      title: "git diff --patch feature main"
      explain: "While '--patch' is a valid option for git diff, it shows the changes in patch format rather than comparing commits between branches. It doesn't solve the requirement to see only commits that exist in the feature branch but not in main."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "git diff --stat feature main"
      explain: "The '--stat' option provides a summary of changes (files modified and lines added/removed) but doesn't show which commits exist in one branch but not the other."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "git log feature..main"
      explain: "This command shows commits that are in main but not in feature, which is the opposite of what is needed in this scenario."

      title: "git log main..feature"

You work at MDFT Academy, which uses Git for source control. You are a developer working on the StudentPortal application. You have been working on a feature branch named 'feature' for several weeks. During this time, the main branch has also been updated by other developers.

Before merging your feature branch back to main, you need to identify which commits exist in your feature branch but do not exist in the main branch. This will help you understand exactly what changes you'll be introducing to the main branch.

Which Git command should you run to list only the commits that exist in the feature branch but not in the main branch?
