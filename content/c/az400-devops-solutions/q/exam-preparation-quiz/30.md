You are a DevOps engineer working on an Azure DevOps project for MDFT Academy's learning management system. Your build process creates several artifacts, and you need to deploy the artifacts to on-premises servers.

Your solution is to deploy an Azure self-hosted agent to an on-premises server. You then add a `Copy and Publish Build Artifacts` task to the deployment pipeline.

Does this solution meet the goal?
