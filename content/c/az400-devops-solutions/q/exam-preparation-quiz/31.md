You work as a DevOps engineer at MDFT Pro, a well-known training provider specializing in technology certification courses. Mark, the CTO, has mandated that all code deployed to production must meet specific quality metrics. Recent deployments of the course planning application has resulted in production issues due to poor code quality. The suite is critical for MDFT Pro as it's used to plan semesters, schedule trainers, and forecast investments for new training facilities.

You have been asked you to implement a solution that will automatically verify code quality metrics such as code coverage (minimum 80%), successful unit tests, and no critical security vulnerabilities before allowing deployments to proceed to production.

What should you add to the release pipeline?
