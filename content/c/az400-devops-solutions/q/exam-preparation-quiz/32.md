MDFT Academy has four educational technology projects. The version control requirements for each project are shown in the following table.

| Project   | Requirement                                                                                     |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Project 1 | Project leads must be able to restrict access to individual files and folders in the repository.|
| Project 2 | The version control system must enforce the following rules before merging any changes to the main branch: <br> -Changes must be reviewed by at least two project members. <br> -Changes must be associated to at least one work team. |
| Project 3 | The project members must be able to work in Azure Repos directly from Xcode.                    |
| Project 4 | The release branch must only be viewable or editable by the project leads.                      |

You plan to use Azure Repos for all the projects.

For which projects should you use the Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) system?
