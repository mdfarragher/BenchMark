title: "Identify Projects Requiring Team Foundation Version Control"

answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "COURSE_APP"
      correct: true
      explain: "COURSE_APP requires restricting access to individual files and folders in the repository, which is a key strength of TFVC. Git does not support file-level permissions, making it unsuitable for this requirement. TFVC provides granular permissions at the file and folder level, allowing project leads to control exactly who can access specific parts of the codebase."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "LAB_ENVIRONMENT"
      explain: "LAB_ENVIRONMENT requires branch policies that enforce review by at least two project members before merging changes. Team Foundation Version Control doesn't support branch policies for code reviews or work item association requirements."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "QUIZ_MODULE"
      explain: "QUIZ_MODULE requires integration with Xcode, which cannot use Team Foundation Version Control."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "CERT_EXAM"
      correct: true
      explain: "CERT_EXAM requires that the release branch be viewable or editable only by project leads. While Git only offers repository-level permissions, TFVC provides granular security permissions that can be applied at the branch level, allowing administrators to restrict access to specific branches to designated users or groups."

MDFT Academy has four educational technology projects. The version control requirements for each project are shown in the following table.

| Project  | Requirement                                                                                     |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| COURSE_APP | Project leads must be able to restrict access to individual files and folders in the repository.|
| LAB_ENVIRONMENT | Before merging any changes to the main branch, changes must be reviewed by at least two project members and must be associated to at least one work team. |
| QUIZ_MODULE | The project members must be able to work in Azure Repos directly from Xcode.                    |
| CERT_EXAM | The release branch must only be viewable or editable by the project leads.                      |

You plan to use Azure Repos for all the projects. For which projects should you use the Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) system?
