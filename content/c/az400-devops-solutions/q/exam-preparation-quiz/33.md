      title: "LAB_ENVIRONMENT"
      correct: true
      explain: "LAB_ENVIRONMENT requires branch policies that enforce review by at least two project members before merging changes. Git excels at this through pull request workflows and branch policies in Azure Repos, allowing teams to enforce code reviews and work item association requirements."

      title: "QUIZ_MODULE"
      correct: true
      explain: "QUIZ_MODULE requires integration with Xcode, which has built-in support for Git repositories."
    - id: "answer4"

MDFT Academy has four educational technology projects. The version control requirements for each project are shown in the following table.

| Project  | Requirement                                                                                     |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| COURSE_APP | Project leads must be able to restrict access to individual files and folders in the repository.|
| LAB_ENVIRONMENT | Before merging any changes to the main branch, changes must be reviewed by at least two project members and must be associated to at least one work team. |
| QUIZ_MODULE | The project members must be able to work in Azure Repos directly from Xcode.                    |
| CERT_EXAM | The release branch must only be viewable or editable by the project leads.                      |

You plan to use Azure Repos for all the projects. For which projects should you use the Git version control system?
