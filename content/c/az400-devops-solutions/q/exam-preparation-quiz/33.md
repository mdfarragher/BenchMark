      title: "Project 1"
      explain: "Project 1 requires restricting access to individual files and folders, which is a feature that TFVC handles better than Git, as Git's security model is primarily at the repository level."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Project 2"
      explain: "Project 2 requires specific rules for merging changes to the main branch that are better enforced in TFVC than in Git for this specific combination of requirements."

MDFT Academy has four educational technology projects. The version control requirements for each project are shown in the following table.

| Project   | Requirement                                                                                     |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Project 1 | Project leads must be able to restrict access to individual files and folders in the repository.|
| Project 2 | The version control system must enforce the following rules before merging any changes to the main branch: <br> -Changes must be reviewed by at least two project members. <br> -Changes must be associated to at least one work team. |
| Project 3 | The project members must be able to work in Azure Repos directly from Xcode.                    |
| Project 4 | The release branch must only be viewable or editable by the project leads.                      |

You plan to use Azure Repos for all the projects.

For which projects should you use the Git Version Control system?
