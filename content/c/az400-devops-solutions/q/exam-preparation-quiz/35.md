      title: "Configure a branch policy for the feature branches"
      explain: "Configuring branch policies on feature branches would not enforce the code coverage requirements when merging into the main branch, as the policy needs to be on the target branch (main) which receives the pull request."

      title: "Configure a branch policy for the main branch"
      correct: true
      explain: "Branch policies on the main branch can enforce code coverage requirements for incoming pull requests. By setting up a branch policy with a required build that includes code coverage checking, you can block pull requests that don't meet the 90% coverage threshold."

      title: "Create a code coverage configuration YAML file"
      explain: "Azure DevOps doesn't use a separate code coverage configuration YAML file to enforce code coverage thresholds on pull requests. Code coverage settings are typically configured within the build pipeline YAML and enforced through branch policies."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Create a Publish Test Results task"
      explain: "While a Publish Test Results task can publish code coverage data, it only makes the results visible in the pipeline. It doesn't enforce a minimum threshold for pull request acceptance. Branch policies are needed to block merges that don't meet requirements."

You work for MDFT Academy as a DevOps engineer. You use an Azure Pipelines pipeline to build and test an app named StudentPortal. The StudentPortal developers use feature branches in a Git repository to store their source code.

You need to ensure that a pull request will merge into the main branch only when testing covers more than 90 percent of the code. What should you do?
