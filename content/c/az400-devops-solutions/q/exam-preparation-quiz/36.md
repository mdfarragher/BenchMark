title: "Choose the Appropriate Identity Solution for Azure Key Vault Access"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Role-based access control (RBAC) permissions"
      explain: "While RBAC can be used to grant permissions to Azure Key Vault, it would require granting permissions to each web server individually, which doesn't minimize the number of permission grants required."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "A user-assigned managed identity"
      correct: true
      explain: "User-assigned managed identities can be created once and shared across multiple resources, making them ideal for VM scale sets. By assigning a single identity to all 100 VMs, you only need to grant the key vault permission once to that identity, minimizing the number of permission grants while maintaining the principle of least privilege."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "A service principal"
      explain: "Service principals require secret management and regular credential rotation, which adds administrative overhead. For VM scale sets with 100 servers, this would be more complex to manage than managed identities and doesn't align with minimizing permission grants."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "A system-assigned managed identity"
      explain: "System-assigned managed identities are tied to specific resources and cannot be shared across multiple VMs. This would require creating 100 separate permission grants in Key Vault (one for each VM), which doesn't meet the requirement to minimize the number of permission grants."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency. The academy has an Azure key vault named KV1 and three web servers. You plan to deploy an app named COURSE_APP to 100 web servers as part of a virtual machine scale set. You need to ensure that COURSE_APP can retrieve a secret from KV1.

The solution must meet the following requirements:
* Minimize the number of permission grants required
* Follow the principle of least privilege

What should you include in the solution?
