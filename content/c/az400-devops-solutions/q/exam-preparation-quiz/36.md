answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Role-based access control (RBAC) permissions"
      explain: "While RBAC can be used to grant permissions to Azure Key Vault, it would require granting permissions to each web server individually, which doesn't minimize the number of permission grants required."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "A user-assigned managed identity"
      explain: "User-assigned managed identities can be shared across multiple resources, but they require more management overhead and don't minimize the number of permission grants as effectively as system-assigned managed identities for this specific scenario."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "A service principal"
      explain: "Service principals require more management overhead, including credential management, which increases complexity and doesn't adhere to the principle of least privilege as effectively as managed identities."

You work for MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency. The academy has an Azure key vault named KV1 and three web servers.

You plan to deploy an app named App1 to the web servers. You need to ensure that App1 can retrieve a secret from KV1.

The solution must meet the following requirements:
* Minimize the number of permission grants required
* Follow the principle of least privilege

What should you include in the solution?
