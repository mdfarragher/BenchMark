title: "Select the Actions to Integrate Prometheus with Azure Monitor"
type: "question"
layout: "multiple"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "On each virtual machine, enable the Azure Diagnostics extension"
      explain: "The Azure Diagnostics extension is for collecting diagnostic logs and metrics, but it doesn't specifically enable Prometheus integration with Azure Monitor. This would collect metrics but not in the Prometheus format needed for this integration."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "On each virtual machine, expose the metrics endpoint"
      correct: true
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Install a Prometheus server on a Linux virtual machine in Azure"
      explain: "While Prometheus servers can run on Linux, for Azure Monitor integration, you don't need to install a separate Prometheus server on a Linux VM. Azure Monitor can scrape Prometheus metrics directly without requiring a dedicated Prometheus server."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Install a Prometheus server on a Windows virtual machine in Azure"
      correct: true
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "On each virtual machine, enable the containerized agent for Azure Monitor"
      explain: "The containerized agent for Azure Monitor is primarily for container monitoring scenarios, not for direct Prometheus integration with virtual machines that aren't running containers."
    - id: "answer6"
      title: "Expose a virtual network service endpoint for Azure Storage"
      explain: "Exposing a service endpoint for Azure Storage doesn't contribute to integrating Prometheus with Azure Monitor. This is used for securing connections to Azure Storage services."

You work at MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency. The academy has an Azure subscription containing virtual machines that run either Windows Server or Linux.

You plan to use Prometheus to monitor performance metrics for the academy's infrastructure. You need to integrate Prometheus and Azure Monitor.

Which two actions should you perform? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.
