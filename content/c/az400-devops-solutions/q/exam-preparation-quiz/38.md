      title: "Progressive exposure"
      explain: "Progressive exposure (also known as canary deployment) gradually routes users to new versions, but it doesn't typically use specific URLs for testing and doesn't optimize for easy promotion or rollback as required."

      title: "Feature toggle"
      explain: "Feature toggles allow enabling/disabling features at runtime, but they increase code complexity and don't provide the easy promotion path or rollback capabilities required in the scenario."

You work for MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency. The academy plans to deploy a solution that will include multiple microservices for their educational platform.

You need to recommend a deployment strategy for the microservices. The solution must meet the following requirements:
* Enable users to test new features by using a specific URL
* Minimize the effort required to promote a test version to production
* Minimize the effort required to revert production code to the previous version

Which strategy should you recommend?
