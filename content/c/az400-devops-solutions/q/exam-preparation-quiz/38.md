title: "Recommend a Deployment Strategy for Microservices"

      title: "Progressive exposure"
      explain: "Progressive exposure (also known as canary deployment) gradually routes users to new versions, but it doesn't typically use specific URLs for testing and doesn't optimize for easy promotion or rollback as required."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Feature toggle"
      explain: "Feature toggles are configuration switches set per user or user group, not linked to specific URLs. Users have no control over feature enablement as these are managed by administrators. They also don't provide the easy promotion path or rollback capabilities required in the scenario."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "A/B testing"
      explain: "A/B testing randomly assigns users to variation A or B. Users cannot control which version they see by visiting a specific URL. It's primarily focused on comparing different versions to gather metrics about user behavior and preferences, rather than providing an efficient deployment strategy with easy promotion and rollback capabilities."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Blue/green"
      correct: true
      explain: "Blue/green deployment makes it easy to roll back to previous versions and provides specific URLs for testing new features, meeting all the requirements of the scenario."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency. The academy plans to deploy a solution that will include multiple microservices for their educational platform.

You need to recommend a deployment strategy for the microservices. The solution must meet the following requirements:
* Enable users to test new features by using a specific URL
* Minimize the effort required to promote a test version to production
* Minimize the effort required to revert production code to the previous version

Which strategy should you recommend?
