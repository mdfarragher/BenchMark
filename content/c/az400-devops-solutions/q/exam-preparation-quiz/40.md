You work for MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency. The academy has developed a .NET app named App1 for managing student enrollment.

You need to upload App1 to GitHub Packages so that other developers at the academy can use it.

How should you complete the command? 

```bash
dotnet ______________ "bin/Release/app1.1.0.0.nupkg" --api-key PAT_TOKEN --source "github"
