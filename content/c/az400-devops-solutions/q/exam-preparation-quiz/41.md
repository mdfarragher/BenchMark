      title: "Organization"
      explain: "Granting permissions at the organization level would provide Mark with excessive permissions across all projects and pipelines, which violates the principle of least privilege."

      title: "Pipeline"
      correct: true
      explain: "Pipeline-level permissions allow Mark to manage specific aspects of Pipeline1, including deleting stages, without granting access to other pipelines. This aligns with the principle of least privilege while providing sufficient access to complete the required task."

      title: "Stage"
      explain: "While stage-level seems like the most granular option, Azure DevOps doesn't provide a built-in mechanism to grant permissions to delete a specific stage."

      title: "Project"
      explain: "Granting permissions at the project level would provide Mark with excessive permissions across all pipelines in the project, which violates the principle of least privilege."

You work for MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency. The academy has an Azure Pipelines pipeline named Pipeline1 that handles the continuous integration and deployment of training materials to the learning management system. Mark is a DevOps engineer responsible for pipeline testing.

Pipeline1 contains a temporary final stage named Final1, which was specifically created to validate new deployment procedures for training content. This stage performs additional verification steps before content is published to the production learning environment. The Final1 stage was only intended to exist during the initial deployment testing phase.

You need to ensure that Mark can delete Final1 when the testing is complete, without giving him unnecessary permissions to other parts of the system. The solution must follow the principle of least privilege.

At which level should you grant permissions to Mark?
