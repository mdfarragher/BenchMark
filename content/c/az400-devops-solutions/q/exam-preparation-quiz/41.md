You work for MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency. The academy has an Azure Pipelines pipeline named Pipeline1 and a user named MARK. Pipeline1 contains a temporary final stage named Final1.

You need to ensure that MARK can delete Final1 when testing is complete. The solution must follow the principle of least privilege.

At which level should you grant permissions to MARK?
