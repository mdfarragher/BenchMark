      title: "Multi-stage builds"
      correct: true
      explain: "Multi-stage builds allow you to use multiple FROM statements in your Dockerfile. Each FROM statement begins a new stage of the build. You can selectively copy artifacts from one stage to another, leaving behind everything you don't need in the final image. This approach minimizes image size by including only the necessary runtime components and eliminates build tools and intermediate files, which also reduces the security surface area."

      title: "Single-stage builds"
      explain: "Single-stage builds typically include build tools and intermediate files in the final image, which increases image size and expands the security surface area, contrary to the requirements."

      title: "PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC)"
      explain: "PowerShell DSC is primarily used for configuration management, not container image optimization. It doesn't address the requirement to minimize image sizes and security surface area for Docker containers."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Docker Swarm"
      explain: "Docker Swarm is a container orchestration solution, not a build strategy. It manages how containers run across multiple hosts but doesn't address how container images are built."

You work for MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency. The academy needs to build Docker containers for their educational applications. You need to recommend a Docker container build strategy that meets the following requirements:

* Minimizes image sizes
* Minimizes the security surface area of the final image

What should you include in the recommendation?
