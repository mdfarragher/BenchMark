You work for MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency. The academy has a project in Azure DevOps.

You plan to create a release pipeline that will deploy educational resources by using Azure Resource Manager templates. The templates will reference secrets stored in Azure Key Vault.

You need to recommend a solution for accessing the secrets stored in the key vault during deployments. The solution must use the principle of least privilege.

What should you include in the recommendation?
