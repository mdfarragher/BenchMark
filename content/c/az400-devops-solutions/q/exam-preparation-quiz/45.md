    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Define a deployment control that invokes the Service Now SOAP API"
      explain: "The Service Now integration with Azure DevOps uses the REST API, not the SOAP API, for change management integrations."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Define a post-deployment gate after the deployment to the Prod stage"
      explain: "A post-deployment gate after the Prod stage wouldn't ensure change requests are processed before production deployment. Post-deployment gates are used to validate deployments after they occur."

      title: "Define a deployment control that invokes the ServiceNow REST API"
      correct: true
      explain: "Azure DevOps integrates with ServiceNow using its REST API to manage change requests. This allows for creating, updating, and validating change requests as part of the deployment pipeline."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Define a pre-deployment gate before the deployment to the Prod stage"
      correct: true
      explain: "A pre-deployment gate before the production stage ensures the Service Now change request is validated and approved before allowing deployment to proceed to production, which satisfies the requirement of processing change requests before production deployment."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, has a project in Azure DevOps for a new web application used in their educational programs.

The academy uses ServiceNow for change management. You need to ensure that a change request is processed before any components can be deployed to the production environment.

What are two ways to integrate ServiceNow change requests into the Azure DevOps release pipeline?
