You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency. The academy has an Azure project that contains Azure DevOps build pipelines. You need to implement caching for Yarn packages in the pipelines using the cache task.

How should you complete the YAML definition? 

```yaml
steps:
- task: Cache@2
  inputs:
    ________________ '"yarn" | "$(Agent.OS)" | yarn.lock'
    path: $(YARN_CACHE_FOLDER)
  displayName: Cache Yarn packages
- script: yarn --frozen-lockfile
```
