title: "Select The Correct Commit Message Format"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Fixes AB#123"
      correct: true
      explain: "This is the correct format for Azure DevOps commit messages to link work items. The 'Fixes' keyword will not only link the commit to the work item but also automatically resolve the work item when the commit is pushed, setting its state to 'Resolved'."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "AB#123 Fixed"
      explain: "This format doesn't follow Azure DevOps' commit message conventions. The keyword 'fixed' should precede the work item number, not follow it."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "AB#123"
      explain: "This format is incomplete. Simply referencing the work item ID without a proper keyword (like 'Fixed' or 'Resolved') will link the commit to the work item but won't automatically change its state to 'Resolved' as required by the question."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Resolved #AB123"
      explain: "While 'Resolved' is a valid keyword (it maps to the work item state 'Resolved'), the format for referencing the work item is incorrect. For Azure Boards integrated with Azure Repos, you should use the syntax 'AB#123'."

You work for MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency that develops educational software for its students. As a DevOps engineer, you manage a project named EDU_PROJ using Azure Boards for work item tracking, and Azure Repos for source code management. 

Your team lead, Claire, reported a critical bug in the student registration module that's preventing new users from enrolling in courses. This bug was documented as work item #123 in Azure Boards. You've identified and fixed the issue in your code.

Now, when you commit your changes to the repository, you need to ensure that the work item is automatically updated to a "Resolved" state. What should you add to your commit message to properly link and resolve this work item?
