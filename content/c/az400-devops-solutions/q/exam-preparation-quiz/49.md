You work for MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency. The academy has a GitHub repository that uses GitHub Actions and stores access keys using GitHub encrypted secrets. You plan to update the secrets programmatically by using the GitHub REST API. Before sending new secrets to the GitHub API, you need to properly encrypt and wrap the secrets.

You have developed a Node.js application to update the secrets. Which encryption library should you use to encrypt and wrap your secrets?
