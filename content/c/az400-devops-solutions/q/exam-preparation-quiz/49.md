You work for MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency. The academy has a GitHub repository that uses GitHub Actions and stores access keys using GitHub encrypted secrets.

You plan to update the secrets by using the GitHub REST API.

You need to wrap the secrets before adding them to a REST-based call.

Which encryption library should you use?
