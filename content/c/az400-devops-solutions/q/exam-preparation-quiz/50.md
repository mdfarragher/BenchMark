title: "Recommend A Solution To Protect Infrastructure Credentials"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Add a Run Inline Azure PowerShell task to the pipeline"
      explain: "Running inline PowerShell does not inherently provide secure handling of credentials. Scripts could potentially expose credentials in logs or to unauthorized users."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Add a PowerShell task to the pipeline and run Set-AzureKeyVaultSecret"
      explain: "Using Set-AzureKeyVaultSecret is for setting secrets in Key Vault, not retrieving them securely for deployment. This would not protect infrastructure credentials during deployment."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Add an Azure Key Vault task to the pipeline"
      explain: "While Azure Key Vault tasks can retrieve secrets during pipeline execution, they may still expose credentials in pipeline variables. This is not as secure as referencing Key Vault directly in ARM templates."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Add Azure Key Vault references to Azure Resource Manager templates"
      correct: true
