      title: "Azure virtual machines"
      explain: "Azure virtual machines run continuously and incur charges even when idle, making them cost-inefficient for a pipeline that only runs once daily for 30 minutes."

      title: "An Azure virtual machine scale set"
      explain: "Azure virtual machine scale sets are designed for autoscaling multiple identical VMs, which is more complex than needed and not the most cost-effective for a single daily build job."

      title: "An Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster"
      explain: "An AKS cluster would be overkill for a single build agent that runs once daily, involving the overhead costs of running a Kubernetes cluster continuously."

You are designing a build pipeline in Azure Pipelines for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency. The pipeline requires a self-hosted agent, it will run once daily and it will take 30 minutes to complete.

You need to recommend a compute type for the agent. The solution must minimize costs.

What should you recommend?
