      title: "Rebase"
      correct: true
      explain: "Rebase can be used to move the commits from the experimental branch onto the main branch in a linear fashion, rewriting history. If followed by a force push, it will override main's previous commit history."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Fetch"
      explain: "Fetch only downloads new commits and files from a remote repository to your local repository without merging them. It doesn't update branches or modify history."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Merge"
      explain: "Merge combines the changes from one branch into another while preserving the commit history of both branches. It doesn't override history as required in the scenario."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Push"
      explain: "Push uploads local repository content to a remote repository. It doesn't modify branch history or combine changes from different branches."

You are developing an application for MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency. The application's source code is stored in a Git repository with multiple branches.

You have made several commits to an experiment branch and now want to integrate those changes into the main branch. To maintain a clean, linear commit history, you want to reapply the experiment branch's commits onto the main branch, effectively rewriting the history of how the changes were introduced.

Which Git option should you use?
