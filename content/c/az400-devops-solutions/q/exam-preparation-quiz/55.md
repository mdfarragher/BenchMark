      title: "docker login ghcr.io -u USERNAME --password-stdin"
      explain: "This command is incorrect because it doesn't use the GITHUB_TOKEN for authentication, which is the recommended approach for GitHub Actions. The token should be passed via the environment."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "echo $GITHUB_TOKEN | docker login ghcr.io -u USERNAME --password-stdin"
      correct: true
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "docker pull ghcr.io/${{ github.repository_owner }}/${{ github.repository }}:latest"
      explain: "This command pulls an existing container from the registry. Since we're creating and pushing a new container, pulling an existing one is unnecessary for this workflow."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "docker build --file Dockerfile --tag ${{ githubrepository }}:latest --label \"runnumber=${{ github.run_number }}\""
      correct: true
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "docker push ghcr.io/${{ github.repository_owner }}/${{ github.repository }}:latest"
      correct: true
    - id: "answer6"
      title: "uses: azure/docker-login@vl"
      explain: "This is using an Azure-specific action instead of the standard Docker commands required for GitHub Container Registry. It's also not properly formatted as a run command."

MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency, uses a GitHub repository to store source code, infrastructure files and action scripts. You plan to add a new GitHub action in the repository to create and deploy a Docker container.

You have the following incomplete script to build the container and deploy it to GitHub Container Registry:

```yaml
steps:
- name: Step 1
  run: 
- name: Step 2
  run: 
- name: Step 3
  run: 
```

Which three 'run' commands should you add to the GitHub action to achieve the goal?
