answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "docker login ghcr.io -u USERNAME --password-stdin"
      explain: "This command is incorrect because it uses the --password-stdin flag but doesn't pipe any input to stdin, so the authentication would fail."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "echo $GITHUB_TOKEN | docker login ghcr.io -u USERNAME --password-stdin"
      correct: true
      explain: "This command correctly authenticates with GitHub Container Registry using the GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable, which is automatically provided by GitHub Actions. It pipes the token to the password-stdin parameter, which is the secure way to provide credentials."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "docker pull ghcr.io/${{ github.repository_owner }}/${{ github.repository }}:latest"
      explain: "This command pulls an existing container from the registry. Since we're creating and pushing a new container, pulling an existing one is unnecessary for this workflow."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "docker build --file Dockerfile --tag ${{ githubrepository }}:latest --label \"runnumber=${{ github.run_number }}\""
      correct: true
      explain: "This command builds the Docker container from the Dockerfile in the repository, tags it with the repository name, and adds a label with the GitHub run number for tracking and versioning purposes."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "docker push ghcr.io/${{ github.repository_owner }}/${{ github.repository }}:latest"
      correct: true
      explain: "This command pushes the built container image to GitHub Container Registry, using the proper format for the registry path that includes both the repository owner and name, which ensures the image is stored in the correct location."
    - id: "answer6"
      title: "uses: azure/docker-login@v1"
      explain: "The 'uses:' keyword belongs one level higher in the workflow YAML structure, not inside a 'run:' statement. Additionally, this task is deprecated, needs additional configuration to work correctly, and should be the first step to execute, not the last."

MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency, uses a GitHub repository to store source code, infrastructure files and workflow actions. You plan to add a new GitHub action in the repository to create and deploy a Docker container.

You have the following incomplete workflow action to build the container and deploy it to GitHub Container Registry:

```yaml
steps:
- name: Step 1
  run: 
- name: Step 2
  run: 
- name: Step 3
  run: 
```

Which three 'run' commands should you add to the GitHub action to achieve the goal?
