      title: "Path filters"
      explain: "Path filters allow you to specify which files in the repository will trigger a build when changed. While useful for limiting unnecessary builds, they don't prevent multiple builds from being queued simultaneously."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Batch changes"
      correct: true
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Scheduled builds"
      explain: "Scheduled builds run at predetermined times rather than being triggered by code changes. This doesn't address the requirement to manage builds triggered by code commits."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Branch filters"
      explain: "Branch filters specify which branches trigger a build when code is pushed. While they control which branches can trigger builds, they don't prevent multiple builds from queuing simultaneously."

You work for MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency. The academy has Azure Pipelines and GitHub integrated as a source code repository for its educational applications. The build pipeline has continuous integration enabled.

You plan to trigger an automated build whenever MDFT Academy's developers commit code changes to the repository. You need to ensure that the system will wait until a build completes before queuing another build.

What should you implement?
