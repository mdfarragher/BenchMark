      title: "Path filters"
      explain: "Path filters define specific file paths that will trigger a build when changed. While they help limit builds to relevant changes, they don't control the queuing behavior between builds. Multiple commits would still trigger separate parallel builds."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Batch changes"
      correct: true
      explain: "Batch changes consolidate multiple commits into a single build when a build is already in progress. When enabled, if changes are made while a build is running, they're held until the current build completes, then all queued changes are built together."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Scheduled builds"
      explain: "Scheduled builds run at predetermined times according to a defined schedule. They're useful for regular maintenance tasks but don't manage the queuing behavior of builds triggered by code commits, which would still run immediately upon each commit."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Branch filters"
      explain: "Branch filters determine which branches will trigger a build when code is pushed. They control which branches participate in CI but don't affect how multiple sequential builds are queued or processed when changes occur rapidly."

You work for MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency. The academy uses Azure Pipelines to build its educational applications, and a GitHub repository to store the source code. The build pipelines have continuous integration (CI) enabled.

You plan to trigger an automated build whenever MDFT Academy's developers commit code changes to the repository. You need to ensure that the system will wait until a build completes before queuing another build.

What should you implement?
