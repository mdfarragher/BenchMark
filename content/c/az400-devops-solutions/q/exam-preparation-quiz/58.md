      title: "git clone --bare https://github.com/mdft.academy/edu_project.git"
      correct: true
      explain: "This command creates a bare clone of the GitHub repository, which contains all the project data without the working files. This is the first step in the migration process."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "cd edu_project.git"
      correct: true
      explain: "After creating the bare clone, you need to navigate into the cloned repository directory to perform the next step of the migration process."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "git push --mirror https://dev.azure.com/mdft.academy/edu_project/_git/edu_project.git"
      correct: true
      explain: "The mirror push command copies all references (branches, tags, etc.) from the cloned GitHub repository to the Azure Repos repository, completing the migration process."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "git push --mirror https://github.com/mdft.academy/edu_project.git"
      explain: "This command would push to the GitHub repository, not to Azure Repos, which contradicts the requirement to migrate from GitHub to Azure Repos."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "cd edu_project"
      explain: "After a bare clone, the directory created would be edu_project.git, not edu_project, so this would be the wrong directory to change into."
    - id: "answer6"
      title: "git clone --bare https://dev.azure.com/mdft.academy/edu_project/_git/edu_project.git"
      explain: "This command would clone from Azure Repos rather than from GitHub, which is the opposite of the migration direction required."

MDFT Academy is using both Azure Repos and GitHub repositories as shown in the following table.

| Type         | URL                                           |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Azure Repos  | https://dev.azure.com/mdft.academy/edu_project/_git/edu_project.git |
| GitHub       | https://github.com/mdft.academy/edu_project.git       |

You have been hired by MDFT Academy to migrate the source code for edu_project from the GitHub repository to the Azure Repos repository. The solution must ensure that after the migration, the Azure Repos repository contains all branches and history from the GitHub repository.

Which three commands should you run in sequence?
