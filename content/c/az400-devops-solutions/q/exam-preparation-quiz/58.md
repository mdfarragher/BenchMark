      title: "git push --mirror https://github.com/contoso/projectl.git"
      explain: "This command would push to the GitHub repository, not to Azure Repos, which contradicts the requirement to migrate from GitHub to Azure Repos."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "cd projectl"
      explain: "After a bare clone, the directory created would be projectl.git, not projectl, so this would be the wrong directory to change into."
    - id: "answer6"
      title: "git clone --bare https://dev.azure.com/contoso/projectl/_git/projectl.git"
      explain: "This command would clone from Azure Repos rather than from GitHub, which is the opposite of the migration direction required."
