      title: "In Azure DevOps, configure tasks in the release pipeline to create and delete virtual machines in Azure DevTest Labs using the ARM template."
      correct: true
      explain: "Azure DevTest Labs is a service that helps developers and testers quickly create environments while minimizing waste and controlling costs. It provides automated VM provisioning through Azure Pipelines integration, allowing VMs to be created on-demand for testing and deleted when the testing is complete. This fulfills all requirements: cost effectiveness through automated cleanup, CI/CD integration, use of existing ARM templates, and Azure DevOps integration."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "From Azure Cloud Shell, run Azure PowerShell commands to create and delete the new virtual machines in a staging resource group."
      explain: "While this approach would work for provisioning VMs, it doesn't provide the automatic provisioning through a pipeline that's required. This manual approach doesn't integrate with the existing DevOps processes."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "In Azure DevOps, configure tasks in the release pipeline to deploy to standard Azure VMs with scheduled start/stop automation."
      explain: "While this approach uses the release pipeline, standard Azure VMs without DevTest Labs would not automatically provision and deprovision as part of the CI/CD process. The scheduled automation is separate from the pipeline execution, which doesn't meet the requirement for automatic provisioning and deprovisioning as part of the CI/CD process."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "In Azure Cloud Shell, run Azure CLI commands to create and delete the new virtual machines in a staging resource group."
      explain: "Similar to the PowerShell option, this approach doesn't provide automatic provisioning through integration with existing pipelines, making it less suitable for the requirements."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training organization, is developing a multi-tier web application to deliver educational content to students. Currently, the production environment runs on Azure virtual machines. The DevOps team has already created an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template that they use to provision testing VMs whenever they need to validate new features before deploying to production.

You need to set up a testing and validation environment that meets the following requirements:

- Minimizes Azure infrastructure costs
- Automatically provisions and deprovisions virtual machines as part of your CI/CD process
- Uses the existing ARM template
- Integrates with Azure DevOps

What should you do?
