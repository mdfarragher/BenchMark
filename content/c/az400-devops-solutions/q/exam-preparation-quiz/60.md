You work for MDFT Academy and are automating the build process for a Java-based educational application by using Azure DevOps. The application is a student assessment platform that allows instructors to create and grade programming assignments.

Your team lead, Claire, has asked you to enhance the CI/CD pipeline to include quality metrics. Specifically, you need to add code coverage testing and publish the outcomes to the pipeline so that the development team can identify areas of the codebase that lack sufficient test coverage.

The application is written in Java and uses Maven as the build tool. You need to select the appropriate tool that integrates well with Azure DevOps pipelines and can provide detailed code coverage reports for Java applications.

What should you use?
