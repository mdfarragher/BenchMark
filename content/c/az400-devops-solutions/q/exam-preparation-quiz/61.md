    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Blue/Green deployment"
      explain: "Blue/Green deployment involves maintaining two identical production environments where one is live and one is idle. While this provides fast rollback capability, it doesn't specifically target a small group of opt-in users for testing."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Canary deployment"
      correct: true
      explain: "Canary deployment allows you to release a new version to a small subset of users before rolling it out to the entire infrastructure. This is ideal for the Student Portal scenario where you need a small group of opted-in users to test new releases before wider deployment."

      title: "Rolling deployment"
      explain: "Rolling deployment gradually replaces instances of the previous version with the new version. This approach doesn't provide the ability to target a specific small group of users who have opted in for testing."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "A/B deployment"
      explain: "A/B deployment is primarily used for testing features against specific metrics or user behavior, not for limiting the exposure of a new release to a small group of users who have opted in."

You are defining release strategies for two applications at MDFT Pro as shown in the following table.

| Application | Goal                                                                                     |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Student Portal   | Failure of Student Portal has a major impact on MDFT Pro. You need a small group of users, who opted in to test Student Portal, to test new releases of the application. |
| Certification Tracker | You need to minimize the time it takes to deploy new releases of Certification Tracker, and you must be able to roll back as quickly as possible. |

Which release strategy should you use for Student Portal?
