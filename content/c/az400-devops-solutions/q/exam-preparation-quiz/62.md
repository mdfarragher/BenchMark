You are defining release strategies for two applications as shown in the following table.

| Application Name | Goal                                                                                     |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Appl             | Failure of Appl has a major impact on your company. You need a small group of users, who opted in to test App1, to test new releases of the application. |
| App2             | You need to minimize the time it takes to deploy new releases of App2, and you must be able to roll back as quickly as possible. |

Which releasestrategy should you use for App2?

- Blue/Green deployment
- Canary deployment
- Rolling deployment (correct)
- A/B deployment
