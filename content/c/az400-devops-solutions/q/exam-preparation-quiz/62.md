      title: "Blue/Green deployment"
      explain: "While Blue/Green deployment does offer quick rollback capability, it requires maintaining two identical production environments which doesn't necessarily minimize deployment time as specified in the requirements."

      title: "Canary deployment"
      explain: "Canary deployment gradually releases changes to a subset of users before rolling out to the entire infrastructure. This focuses on risk mitigation rather than minimizing deployment time."

      title: "A/B deployment"
      explain: "A/B deployment is used for testing different versions of an application simultaneously, typically to gather user feedback or metrics. This doesn't address the requirement to minimize deployment time."

You are defining release strategies for two applications at MDFT Academy as shown in the following table.

| Application Name | Goal                                                                                     |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| App1             | Failure of App1 has a major impact on MDFT Academy. You need a small group of users, who opted in to test App1, to test new releases of the application. |
| App2             | You need to minimize the time it takes to deploy new releases of App2, and you must be able to roll back as quickly as possible. |

Which release strategy should you use for App2?
