      title: "Blue/Green deployment"
      correct: true
      explain: "Blue/Green deployment maintains two identical production environments where one is live and the other is idle. New releases are deployed to the idle environment, and traffic is switched once deployment is complete. This strategy minimizes deployment time and allows for immediate rollback by simply switching traffic back to the previous environment, meeting the requirements for the Certification Tracker application."

      title: "Canary deployment"
      explain: "Canary deployment gradually rolls out changes to a small subset of users before releasing to the entire infrastructure. While this is useful for validating changes with minimal impact, it doesn't provide the immediate rollback capability needed for Certification Tracker where deployment speed and quick rollback are priorities."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Rolling deployment"
      explain: "Rolling deployment updates instances gradually in small batches. This approach is time-consuming as it requires verification at each stage, which doesn't satisfy the requirement to minimize deployment time for Certification Tracker. Additionally, rollback can be complex and slow if issues are discovered."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "A/B deployment"
      explain: "A/B deployment is primarily designed for testing different versions against each other to gather metrics on user behavior and feature performance. It doesn't focus on minimizing deployment time or providing quick rollback capability, which are the key requirements for the Certification Tracker application."

You are defining release strategies for two applications at MDFT Pro as shown in the following table.

| Application | Goal                                                                                     |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Student Portal   | Failure of Student Portal has a major impact on MDFT Pro. You need a small group of users, who opted in to test Student Portal, to test new releases of the application. |
| Certification Tracker | You need to minimize the time it takes to deploy new releases of Certification Tracker, and you must be able to roll back as quickly as possible. |

Which release strategy should you use for Certification Tracker?
