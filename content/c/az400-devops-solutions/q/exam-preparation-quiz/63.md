title: "Identify the First Step for Azure Pipeline Deployment Automation"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Create a service principal"
      explain: "Service principals are an authentication method for Azure services, but they require credential management and rotation, which doesn't align with the requirement to minimize administrative effort and credential management."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Create an Azure Automation account"
      explain: "Azure Automation accounts are used for process automation, configuration management, and update management across Azure and non-Azure environments, but they aren't specifically designed for Azure Pipeline agents and would add unnecessary complexity."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "On each virtual machine, enable a system-assigned managed identity"
      explain: "System-assigned managed identities are tied to specific resources and are deleted when the resource is deleted. This option would require managing multiple identities separately, increasing administrative overhead rather than minimizing it."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Create a user-assigned managed identity"
      correct: true
      explain: "User-assigned managed identities can be shared across multiple resources, allowing both virtual machines to use the same identity. This minimizes administrative effort and eliminates credential management concerns, as the identity is managed by Azure."

You work for MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency. The organization uses an Azure subscription to host their learning management system in the cloud, and they manually deploy infrastructure like websites and Azure SQL using Bicep templates. 

You have been hired by MDFT Academy to automate these deployments. Your assignment is to design and build Azure Pipelines and a self-hosted agent that runs on two virtual machines. The solution must minimize administrative effort and credential management.

What should you do first?
