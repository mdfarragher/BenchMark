title: "Recover a Deleted Git Branch"
type: "question"
layout: "multiple"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "git log"
      correct: true
      explain: "The git log command helps locate the SHA1 hash of the last commit on the deleted branch. It displays the commit history and allows you to identify the specific commit where the branch was before deletion."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "git checkout (SHA1)"
      correct: true
      explain: "After identifying the commit hash with git log, the git checkout command with the SHA1 parameter moves your repository to the state of that specific commit, positioning you at the point where the branch existed. Note that there is also a shorthand command 'git checkout -b <branch> <hash>' that combines the checkout and the subsequent branch operation."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "git branch features/feature11"
      correct: true
      explain: "Once you've checked out the commit, this command creates a new branch with the same name as the deleted branch at the current commit position, effectively recovering the deleted branch with all its content."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "git restore (SHA1)"
      explain: "The git restore command is used to restore files in the working tree from the index or another commit, not for recovering deleted branches. This command doesn't help establish a branch at a previous commit point."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "git stash"
      explain: "The git stash command is used to temporarily store modified tracked files to save changes without committing. It doesn't help in recovering deleted branches as it doesn't interact with the branch structure of the repository."

At MDFT Academy, you have an Azure Repos repository named repo1 that contains educational materials. You accidentally deleted a branch named features/feature11 that contained important course materials. You need to recover the deleted branch.

Your colleague Claire tells you that she had pulled the branch before it was deleted, but she doesn't remember the exact commit ID. The branch contained updated course content for a new Azure certification prep exam that needs to be delivered to students next week.

You need to find the lost commit and recreate the branch with all its content intact. Which three commands should you run in sequence to recover the deleted branch?
