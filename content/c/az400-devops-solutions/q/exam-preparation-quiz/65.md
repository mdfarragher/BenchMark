You have the following Azure policy.

```json
if: {
    allof: [
        {
            "field": "type",
            "equals": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts"
        },
        {
            "field": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/supportsHttpsTrafficOnly",
            "notEguals": "true"
        }
    ]
},
then: {
    effect: "deny"
}
```

You assign the policy to the Tenant root group.
What is the effect of the policy?

A. prevents all http traffic to existing Azure Storage accounts
B. ensures that all traffic to new Azure Storage accounts is encrypted (correct)
C. prevents HTTPS traffic to new Azure Storage accounts when the accounts are accessed over the Internet
D. ensures that all data for new Azure Storage accounts is encrypted at rest
