MDFT Pro has implemented the following Azure policy to secure its educational resources:

```json
{
    "if": {
        "allOf": [
            {
                "field": "type",
                "equals": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts"
            },
            {
                "field": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/supportsHttpsTrafficOnly",
                "notEquals": "true"
            }
        ]
    },
    "then": {
        "effect": "deny"
    }
}
```

You assign the policy to the Tenant root group. What is the effect of the policy?
