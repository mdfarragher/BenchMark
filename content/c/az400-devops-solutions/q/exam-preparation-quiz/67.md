      title: "From Azure Pipelines, enable continuous integration for TrainingMaterials"

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training organization. As part of improving the development workflow for your team, you've been tasked with setting up proper notifications for your CI/CD pipeline.

You have already installed the Azure Pipelines app in Microsoft Teams and configured a subscription to the TrainingMaterials project in your MDFT Azure DevOps organization. However, your team has been receiving too many notifications. You need to modify the settings so that team members only receive notifications when builds fail. 

What should you do?
