title: "Find and Isolate Shared Code for Package Maintenance"
type: "question"
layout: "multiple"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Create a dependency graph for each application"
      correct: true
      explain: "Creating dependency graphs helps visualize how components interconnect across applications, making it easier to identify shared code that can be extracted into reusable packages."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Group all related components"
      correct: true
      explain: "Grouping related components based on functionality or domain allows for logical organization of shared code, which simplifies package creation and maintenance."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Identify the most common language used"
      explain: "Identifying the most common language isn't necessary for finding and isolating shared code. The focus should be on understanding dependencies and functionality, not standardizing on a single language."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Rewrite the components in the most common language"
      explain: "Rewriting components in a common language is unnecessary and could introduce bugs. The goal is to isolate shared code into packages, not to rewrite existing functionality."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "Assign ownership to each component group"
      correct: true
      explain: "Assigning ownership establishes clear responsibility for maintaining each package, ensuring that shared code remains high-quality and continues to meet the needs of all dependent applications."

You work for MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency. The CTO, Mark, has asked you to find and isolate shared code across their various learning applications. This shared code will be maintained in a series of packages to improve maintainability and reusability.

Which three actions should you perform in sequence?
