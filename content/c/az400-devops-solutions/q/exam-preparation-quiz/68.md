      title: "Identify the most common language used"
      explain: "Identifying the most common language isn't necessary for finding and isolating shared code. The focus should be on understanding dependencies and functionality, not standardizing on a single language."

      title: "Rewrite the components in the most common language"
      explain: "Rewriting components in a common language is unnecessary and could introduce bugs. The goal is to isolate shared code into packages, not to rewrite existing functionality."
