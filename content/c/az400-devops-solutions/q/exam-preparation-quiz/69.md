You work at MDFT Pro, which has an Azure DevOps organization named MDFT that contains a project named CourseBuilder.

Your team has provisioned an Azure key vault named TrainingSecrets to store sensitive information used in your training applications. This key vault contains database connection strings, API keys, and other credentials that should not be stored directly in your source code or pipeline configuration.

You are working with Mark, the DevOps lead, on implementing a CI/CD pipeline for the new student assessment application. The application needs to access several sensitive configuration values during both build and deployment processes.

You need to reference the TrainingSecrets vault's secrets in a build pipeline of CourseBuilder in a secure way that follows DevOps best practices. What should you do first?
