      title: "In a Gradle build task, select Run Checkstyle"
      explain: "While Checkstyle can help with code quality in Java projects using Gradle, it doesn't specifically target issues like unused variables and empty catch blocks as effectively as PMD."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "In an Xcode build task, select Use xcpretty from Advanced"
      explain: "Xcpretty is a formatting tool for Xcode build output to make it more readable. It doesn't analyze code for quality issues like unused variables or empty catch blocks."

      title: "In a Grunt build task, select Enabled from Control Options"
      explain: "Enabling a Grunt build task only ensures the task runs. It doesn't provide specific code quality analysis for issues like unused variables and empty catch blocks."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "In a Maven build task, select Run PMD Analysis"
      correct: true
      explain: "PMD is a source code analyzer that specifically excels at finding common programming flaws like unused variables, empty catch blocks, unnecessary object creation, and other code smells. When enabled in a Maven build task, it can automatically scan Java code during the build process and generate reports highlighting these issues."

You are a developer at MDFT Academy, a leading educational technology company. While reviewing code for one of the academy's training applications, you notice significant quality issues throughout the codebase. Specifically, many Java modules contain unused variables and empty catch blocks that could lead to hidden bugs and maintenance difficulties. 

Your manager Claire has asked you to recommend a solution that can be integrated into the existing build pipeline to automatically identify these issues during future code reviews. 

What should you recommend?
