You work for MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency. You plan to use Desired State Configuration (DSC) to maintain the configuration state of virtual machines that run Windows Server for the academy's training environments.

You need to perform the following tasks:
* Install Internet Information Services (IIS) on the virtual machines
* Update the default home page of the IIS web server

You have the following incomplete DSC configuration file:

```powershell
Configuration WebserverConfig {
    Import-DscResource -ModuleName PsDesiredStateConfiguration
    Node "localhost" {
        WindowsFeature Webserver {
            Ensure = "Present"
            Name = "Web-Server"
        }
        ___________ DefaultHomePage {
            Ensure = "Present"
            SourcePath = "\\server1\DSCResources\web\index.htm"
            DestinationPath = "C:\inetpub\wwwroot"
        }
    }
}
```

Which command should you insert at the underlined location to complete the file?
