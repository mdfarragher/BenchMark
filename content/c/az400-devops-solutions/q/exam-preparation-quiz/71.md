You work for MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency. You plan to use Desired State Configuration (DSC) to maintain the configuration state of virtual machines that run Windows Server for your training environments.

You need to perform the following:
* Install Internet Information Services (IIS) on the virtual machines
* Update the default home page of the IIS web server

How should you configure the DSC configuration file? To answer, select the appropriate option for the blank in the code.

```powershell
Configuration WebserverConfig {
    Import-DscResource -ModuleName PsDesiredStateConfiguration
    Node 'localhost' {
        WindowsFeature Webserver {
            Ensure = "Present"
            Name = "Web-Server"
        }
        ___________ DefaultHomePage {
            Ensure = "Present"
            SourcePath = "\\server1\DSCResources\web\index.htm"
            DestinationPath = "C:\inetpub\wwwroot"
        }
    }
}
```
