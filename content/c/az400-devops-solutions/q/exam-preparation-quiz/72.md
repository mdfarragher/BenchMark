You work for MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency. You have an Azure subscription that contains an Azure Pipelines pipeline named CourseBuilder and an application named LearningPortal. The CourseBuilder pipeline is used to automate the building of the LearningPortal application.

You have a Slack channel named learning-portal-updates that includes an incoming webhook. You need to ensure that when a successful build of LearningPortal is created, a notification is sent to the learning-portal-updates channel by using the webhook.

What should you use?
