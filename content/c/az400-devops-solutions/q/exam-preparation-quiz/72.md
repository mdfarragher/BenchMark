You are a DevOps engineer at MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency. As part of your responsibilities, you manage an Azure subscription that hosts an Azure Pipelines pipeline called CourseBuilder. This pipeline is critical for automating the build process of the LearningPortal application, which delivers educational content to students.

Your team has recently set up a dedicated Slack channel named learning-portal-updates with an incoming webhook configured. The team lead has tasked you with integrating Azure DevOps with Slack so that whenever the LearningPortal application is successfully built by the CourseBuilder pipeline, a notification is automatically sent to the learning-portal-updates Slack channel using the webhook.

What should you use in Azure DevOps to accomplish this integration?
