    - id: "answer1"
      title: "r"
      explain: "The 'r' permission only provides read access to the directory, which is insufficient for the Log Analytics agent that needs to write data and traverse the directory."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "x"
      explain: "The 'x' permission only provides execute/traverse access to the directory, without the ability to read or write files, which is insufficient for the Log Analytics agent."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "rx"
      explain: "The 'rx' permissions provide read and execute access, but the Log Analytics agent also needs write permission to create and modify files in the /tmp directory."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "rwx"
      correct: true
      explain: "The 'rwx' permissions provide read, write, and execute access, which is necessary for the Log Analytics agent to properly function. The agent needs to read files, write data, and traverse directories to operate correctly with the /tmp directory."

You work for MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency. You manage an Azure virtual machine named TrainingVM1 that runs Linux. This VM hosts various educational materials and lab environments for certification training courses.

You're implementing the Desired State Configuration (DSC) extension on TrainingVM1 to maintain consistent configuration across all training environments. As part of this implementation, you need to configure the Log Analytics agent with proper directory permissions.

You're using the `setfacl` command to grant specific permissions to the omsagent user:

```bash
setfacl -m u:omsagent: ______________ /tmp
```

Which permission set should you insert at the underlined location to ensure the Log Analytics agent functions correctly?
