You work for MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency. You have an Azure virtual machine named TrainingVM1 that runs Linux. This VM is used to host educational materials and lab environments for students.

You plan to deploy the Desired State Configuration (DSC) extension to TrainingVM1 to ensure consistent configuration across training environments.

You need to grant the Log Analytics agent the appropriate directory permissions. How should you complete the command?

```bash
setfacl -m u:omsagent: ______________ /tmp
```
