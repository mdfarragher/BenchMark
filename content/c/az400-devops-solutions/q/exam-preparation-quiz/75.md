      explain: "The proposed YAML configuration fails to meet all requirements. The default condition for stages is 'succeeded()', meaning Publish_Test_Results would only run if previous stages succeeded, not when they fail. The 'condition: succeeded() || failed()' directive is needed to ensure it always runs. Also, the Publish_Test_Results stage has no dependencies defined, which means it would run immediately when the pipeline is triggered, not after the test stages complete as required. The 'dependsOn: [Test_App, Test_Database]' directive is needed to ensure the stage runs after all tests have completed."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency. As a DevOps engineer, you are tasked with configuring an Azure Pipelines pipeline for the academy's new educational application and its associated database.

Your pipeline must satisfy the following technical requirements:

* All test stages must run in parallel to minimize the overall pipeline duration
* The test stages must only execute if the build stage completes successfully
* The Publish_Test_Results stage must execute regardless of whether the test stages succeed or fail
* The Publish_Test_Results stage must only run after all test stages have completed

You have proposed the following YAML configuration for the pipeline:

```yaml
stages:
- stage: Build_App
  jobs: ...
- stage: Test_App
  dependsOn: [Build_App]
  jobs: ...
- stage: Test_Database
  dependsOn: [Build_App]
  jobs: ...
- stage: Publish_Test_Results
  jobs: ...
```

Does this configuration meet all the stated requirements?
