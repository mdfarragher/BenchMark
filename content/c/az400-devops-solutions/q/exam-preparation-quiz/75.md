You need to use an Azure Pipelines pipeline to build and test an app and test the database of the app. The solution must meet the following requirements.
* Thetest stages must be run in parallel.
* The Publish_Test_Results stage must always be run.
* The test stages must be run after successful completion of the build stage.
* The Publish_Test_Results stage must be run after completion of all the test stages Solution: You include the following elements in the YAML definition of the pipeline.

```yaml
stages:
- stage: Build_App
  jobs: ...
- stage: Test App
  dependsOn: [Buiid_App]
  jobs: ...
- stage:  Test Database
  dependsOn: [Build_App]
  jobs: ...
- stage: Publish_Test_Results
  ...
```

Does this meet the goal?

- Yes
- No (correct)
