      explain: "The provided YAML does not ensure that the Publish_Test_Results stage always runs. It lacks the 'condition' property needed to guarantee execution regardless of whether previous stages succeed or fail."

You work for MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency. You need to use an Azure Pipelines pipeline to build and test an educational app and test the database of the app. The solution must meet the following requirements:

* The test stages must be run in parallel.
* The Publish_Test_Results stage must always be run.
* The test stages must be run after successful completion of the build stage.
* The Publish_Test_Results stage must be run after completion of all the test stages.

Solution: You include the following elements in the YAML definition of the pipeline:

```yaml
stages:
- stage: Build_App
  jobs: ...
- stage: Test_App
  dependsOn: [Build_App]
  jobs: ...
- stage: Test_Database
  dependsOn: [Build_App]
  jobs: ...
- stage: Publish_Test_Results
  jobs: ...
```

Does this meet the goal?
