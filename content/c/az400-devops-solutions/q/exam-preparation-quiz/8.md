You work as an automation engineer at MDFT Academy, a well-known training provider. The academy uses Azure Automation State Configuration (DSC) to manage its test server environments.

You run the `Register-AzAutomationDscNode` command in MDFT Academy's environment. You need to ensure that the test servers maintain their correct configuration, even if configuration drift occurs.

Your proposed solution is to set the `-ConfigurationMode` parameter to ApplyOnly.

Does this solution meet the requirement?
