This quiz will test your knowledge of Azure cloud concepts. You will be tested on your knowledge of cloud computing, the benefits of cloud services, and the three cloud service types: IaaS, PaaS and Saas.

The quiz questions are similar to what you can expect on the actual AZ-900 certification exam. Roughly 25-30% of the questions you'll get on the actual exam will be about cloud concepts.
