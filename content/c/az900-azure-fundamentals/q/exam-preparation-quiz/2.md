      title: "Geo-redundant storage"
      explain: "While geo-redundant storage (GRS) replicates data to a secondary region, it does not provide read access to the data in the secondary location. This does not meet the requirement for data to be readable from the secondary location."

      title: "Read-only geo-redundant storage"
      correct: true

    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Zone-redundant storage"
      explain: "Zone-redundant storage (ZRS) replicates data across availability zones within a single region. This does not meet the requirement for data to be stored in separate geographic locations."

    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Locally redundant storage"
      explain: "Locally redundant storage (LRS) only replicates data within a single data center. This does not meet the requirements for data to be stored in separate geographic locations."

Your company has datacenters in Los Angeles and New York. The company has a Microsoft Azure subscription.
You are configuring the two datacenters as geo-clustered sites for site resiliency.
You need to recommend an Azure storage redundancy option.

You have the following data storage requirements:
- Data must be stored on multiple nodes
- Data must be stored on nodes in separate geographic locations
- Data can be read from the secondary location as well as from the primary location

Which of the following Azure storage redundancy options should you recommend?
