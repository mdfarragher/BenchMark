      title: "Geo-distribution provides a continuous user experience with no apparent downtime."
      explain: "While geo-distribution is an important strategy for improving availability and performance by placing resources closer to users, it alone does not guarantee continuous user experience with no apparent downtime. Geo-distribution is often used as part of a high availability or disaster recovery strategy, but it's the overall high availability design that ensures continuous operation."

      title: "Scalability provides a continuous user experience with no apparent downtime."
      explain: "Scalability refers to a system's ability to handle increased load by adding resources, but it doesn't inherently provide continuous user experience with no downtime. While scalability is important for maintaining performance under varying loads, it's different from high availability which focuses on preventing downtime."

      title: "Disaster recovery provides a continuous user experience with no apparent downtime."
      explain: "Disaster recovery (DR) is focused on recovering from major disruptions and restoring business operations after a disaster. While DR is crucial for business continuity, it typically involves some recovery time and potential downtime during the failover process. It's not designed to provide continuous user experience with no apparent downtime."
