      title: "A physical server failure"
      explain: "While Azure does protect against physical server failures, this is primarily handled through redundancy within a single datacenter, not through Availability Zones. Availability Zones are designed to protect against larger-scale datacenter failures, not individual server failures."

      title: "An Azure region failure"
      explain: "Availability Zones cannot protect against an entire region failure because all zones are located within the same region (typically within 100km of each other). To protect against region failures, you need to implement cross-region redundancy or geo-replication strategies."

      title: "A storage failure"
      explain: "While storage services can be configured to use Availability Zones for redundancy, a storage failure itself is not the primary type of failure that Availability Zones are designed to protect against. Availability Zones protect against datacenter-level failures that could affect all types of services, not just storage."

MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency, is designing its Azure environment to ensure high availability for critical student and trainer applications. The IT team is considering the use of Azure Availability Zones to protect against service disruptions.

Mark, who manages the academy's business continuity planning, wants to identify the types of failures that can be mitigated by using Availability Zones in Azure. 

Which type of failure should Mark identify?
