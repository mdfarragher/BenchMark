type: question
layout: single
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "An Azure subscription can be associated to multiple Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenants."
      explain: "This is incorrect. An Azure subscription can only be associated with one Azure AD tenant at a time. While you can change which tenant a subscription is associated with, it cannot be associated with multiple tenants simultaneously."

    - id: "answer2"
      title: "You can change the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant to which an Azure subscription is associated"
      correct: true

    - id: "answer3"
      title: "When an Azure subscription expires, the associated Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant is deleted automatically."
      explain: "This is incorrect. The Azure AD tenant is independent of subscription status. When a subscription expires, the Azure AD tenant and its directory data remain intact and can be used with other active subscriptions."

    - id: "answer4"
      title: "None of the statements are correct"
      explain: "This is incorrect because the second statement is true - you can change the Azure AD tenant to which a subscription is associated, following proper procedures and permissions."
