      title: "Two Azure subscriptions can be merged into a single subscription"
      explain: "This is incorrect. While you can move resources between subscriptions, Azure does not provide a way to directly merge two subscriptions into one. Each subscription remains a separate billing and management entity."

      correct: true

    - id: "answer4"
