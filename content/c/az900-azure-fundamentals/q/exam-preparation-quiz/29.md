MDFT Academy has an Azure environment that contains multiple Azure virtual machines connected to a virtual network. You plan to implement a hybrid solution that enables the client computers on the on-premises network to communicate with the Azure virtual machines in the cloud. You need to recommend which Azure resources must be created for the planned solution.

Which two Azure resources should you include in the recommendation?
