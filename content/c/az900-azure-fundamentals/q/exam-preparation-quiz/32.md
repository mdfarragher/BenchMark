      title: "Availability zones can be implemented in all Azure regions"
      explain: "This is incorrect. Not all Azure regions support availability zones. Only selected Azure regions provide availability zones, which are separated groups of datacenters within a region."

    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Only virtual machines that run Windows Server can be created in availability zones"
      explain: "This is incorrect. Availability zones support both Windows and Linux virtual machines, as well as many other Azure services. The operating system type does not determine whether a resource can use availability zones."

      title: "Availability zones are used to replicate data and applications to multiple regions"
      explain: "This is incorrect. Availability zones are used for high availability within a single region, not across multiple regions. They are physically separate datacenters within the same region, typically separated by several kilometers but within 100km."
