      title: "A resource group for QUIZSERVER01 and another resource group for all the other servers"
      explain: "Resource groups are used for management and organization of Azure resources, not for network isolation. Resource groups do not provide network segmentation."

      correct: true

      title: "A VPN for QUIZSERVER01 and a virtual network gateway for each other server"
      explain: "VPNs and virtual network gateways are used for connecting networks, not for creating network segments within Azure. This would be an overly complex and incorrect solution for network segmentation."

      title: "One resource group for all the servers and a resource lock for QUIZSERVER01"
      explain: "Resource locks are used to prevent accidental deletion or modification of resources, not for network segmentation. They do not provide network isolation."
