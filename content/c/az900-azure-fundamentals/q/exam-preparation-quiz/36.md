title: "Determine the correct composite SLA"
type: question
layout: single
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "The product of both SLAs, which equals 99.94 percent"
      correct: true

    - id: "answer2"
      title: "The lowest SLA associated to the application, which is 99.95 percent"
      explain: "When services are used together in series (one depending on another), you must multiply the individual SLAs to get the composite SLA, as each service must be available for the application to function."

    - id: "answer3"
      title: "The highest SLA associated to the application, which is 99.99 percent"
      explain: "Using the highest SLA would overstate the availability of the application. Since both services must be available for the application to function, you must multiply the individual SLAs."

    - id: "answer4"
      title: "The difference between the two SLAs, which is 0.05 percent"
      explain: "The difference between SLAs is not a meaningful measure. For services in series, you multiply the individual SLAs to calculate the composite SLA (99.95% Ã— 99.99% = 99.94%)."
