MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency, is implementing resource locks in Azure to prevent accidental deletion of critical resources used by students and trainers. The IT team is reviewing how resource locks affect administrative permissions and resource management.

Mark, who manages Azure governance, wants to ensure that all staff understand the process for deleting locked resource groups and the steps required to remove a lock.

He asks you to evaluate the following statement:

"If a resource group named QUIZGROUP has a delete lock, _______ can delete QUIZGROUP."

What is the missing text in Mark's statement?
