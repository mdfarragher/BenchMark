      explain: "Incorrect. Modifying the DDoS protection plan will not enable HTTP access to a virtual machine. DDoS protection is designed to protect against denial of service attacks, but it does not configure inbound access rules. To allow HTTP access, you need to configure the Network Security Group (NSG) rules and ensure the VM has a public IP address."

Your Azure environment contains multiple Azure virtual machines. You need to ensure that a virtual machine named VM1 is accessible from the Internet over HTTP. Solution: You modify the DDoS protection plan. Does this meet the goal?
