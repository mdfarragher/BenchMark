      explain: "Incorrect. Modifying the Network Security Group (NSG) is the correct solution to allow HTTP access to a virtual machine. NSGs contain security rules that control inbound and outbound traffic, and you can create a rule to allow inbound traffic on port 80 (HTTP) from the Internet to the VM."

Your Azure environment contains multiple Azure virtual machines. You need to ensure that a virtual machine named VM1 is accessible from the Internet over HTTP. Solution: You modify the Network Security Group. Does this meet the goal?
