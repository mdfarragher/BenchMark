      explain: "Incorrect. Azure Traffic Manager is a DNS-based traffic load balancer that enables distribution of traffic across multiple endpoints. It does not control or configure direct access to VMs. To allow HTTP access to a VM, you need to configure the Network Security Group (NSG) rules and ensure the VM has a public IP address."

Your Azure environment contains multiple Azure virtual machines. You need to ensure that a virtual machine named VM1 is accessible from the Internet over HTTP. Solution: You modify an Azure Traffic Manager profile. Does this meet the goal?
