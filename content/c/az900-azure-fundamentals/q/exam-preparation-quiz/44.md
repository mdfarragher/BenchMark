      title: "Implement Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)"
      explain: "While MFA is an important security feature, implementing it alone would not minimize the impact of migrating from on-premises Active Directory to Azure. In fact, implementing MFA without proper synchronization could cause additional disruption."

      title: "Sync all the Active Directory user accounts to Azure Entra"
      correct: true

    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Instruct all users to change their password"
      explain: "Requiring all users to change their passwords would create unnecessary disruption. With proper synchronization, users can continue using their existing credentials."

    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Create a guest user account in Azure Entra for each user"
      explain: "Creating guest accounts would create new, separate identities rather than maintaining users' existing identities. This would cause significant disruption as users would need to manage multiple accounts."

MDFT Academy has an on-premises network that contains an Active Directory forest. The forest contains 5,000 user accounts. The company plans to migrate all network resources to Azure and to decommission the on-premises data center. 

You need to recommend a solution to minimize the impact on users after the planned migration.
