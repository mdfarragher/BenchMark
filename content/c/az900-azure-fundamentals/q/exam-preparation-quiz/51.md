    - id: "answer1"
      title: "A read-only lock"
      explain: "Incorrect. A read-only lock prevents any modifications to a resource but cannot restrict resource creation to specific regions. Resource locks are used to prevent accidental deletion or modification of resources."

      title: "An Azure policy"
      correct: true

    - id: "answer3"
      title: "A management group"
      explain: "Incorrect. While management groups help organize subscriptions and apply governance across multiple subscriptions, they cannot directly restrict resource creation to specific regions. You would still need an Azure policy to enforce location restrictions."

      title: "A reservation"
      explain: "Incorrect. A reservation is used for committing to virtual machines for a one or three-year period to receive pricing discounts. It has no capability to restrict resource creation to specific regions."
