    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Azure Storage Account"
      explain: "Incorrect. Azure Storage Account is a storage solution for files, blobs, queues, and tables. While it can store large amounts of data, it does not provide MPP capabilities for complex query processing."

    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Azure Databricks"
      explain: "Incorrect. While Azure Databricks is a powerful analytics platform, it is primarily designed for big data processing and machine learning workloads using Apache Spark, not specifically for MPP in a relational database context."

    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Azure Data Lake"
      explain: "Incorrect. Azure Data Lake is a storage repository for big data analytics workloads, but it does not provide the MPP query capabilities in a relational database context."

      title: "Azure Synapse Analytics"
      correct: true

    - id: "answer5"
      title: "Azure SQL Database"
      explain: "Incorrect. While Azure SQL Database is a managed relational database service, it is optimized for OLTP workloads and does not provide the same level of MPP capabilities as Azure Synapse Analytics."

    - id: "answer6"
      title: "Azure CosmosDb"
      explain: "Incorrect. Azure CosmosDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service. While it provides global distribution and scaling, it is not designed for MPP of complex queries in a relational database context."

more: "Azure Synapse Analytics leverages a distributed query engine that optimizes queries for parallel processing across compute nodes, with data stored in Azure Storage and processed using MPP architecture."
