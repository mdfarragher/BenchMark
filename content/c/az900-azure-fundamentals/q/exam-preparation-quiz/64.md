      title: "A virtual machine data disk"
      explain: "While a virtual machine data disk can store files, it cannot be directly mapped as a network drive from Windows 10 computers. It would require setting up a file server VM to share the disk, which is more complex and costly than using Azure Files."

You need to create a storage solution in Azure for the planned mapped drive. What should you create?
