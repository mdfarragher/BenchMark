answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "An Azure SQL database"
      explain: "Incorrect. Azure SQL Database is a relational database service and cannot be used as a mapped network drive. It is designed for storing structured data in tables, not for file storage that can be accessed as a network drive."

      title: "A virtual machine data disk"
      explain: "Incorrect. While a virtual machine data disk can store files, it cannot be directly mapped as a network drive from Windows 10 computers. It would require setting up a file server VM to share the disk, which is more complex and costly than using Azure Files."

      title: "An Azure Storage Account File Share"
      correct: true

    - id: "answer4"
      title: "An Azure Storage Account Container"
      explain: "Incorrect. Azure Storage Account Containers are used for blob storage and cannot be directly mapped as network drives in Windows 10. They are designed for object storage and require specific APIs or tools for access."

more: "Azure Files provides fully managed file shares in the cloud that are accessible via the industry standard Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. Azure file shares can be mounted concurrently by cloud or on-premises deployments of Windows, Linux, and macOS."
