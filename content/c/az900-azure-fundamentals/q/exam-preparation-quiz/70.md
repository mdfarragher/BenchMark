MDFT Academy developers intend to deploy a large number of custom virtual machines on a weekly basis. They will also be removing these virtual machines during the same week they are deployed. Sixty percent of the virtual machines have Windows Server 2016 installed, while the other forty percent have Ubuntu Linux 22.04 installed.
