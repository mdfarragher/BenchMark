Your company's developers intend to deploy a large number of custom virtual machines on a weekly basis. They will also be removing these virtual machines during the same week it was deployed. Sixty percent of the virtual machines have Windows Server 2016 installed, while the other forty percent has Ubuntu Linux installed.

You are required to make sure that the administrative effort, needed for this process, is reduced by employing a suitable Azure service.

Solution: You recommend the use of Azure Reserved Virtual Machines (VM) Instances.

Does the solution meet the goal?
