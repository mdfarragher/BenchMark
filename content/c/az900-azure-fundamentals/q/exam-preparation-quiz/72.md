    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Configure a VNet-toVNet VPN"
      explain: "Incorrect. VNet-to-VNet VPN connects two Azure virtual networks together. It does not provide remote user access to VMs in a VNet."

      correct: true

    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Configure DirectAccess on a Windows Server 2012 server VM"

    - id: "answer5"
      title: "Configure a Multi-Site VPN"
      explain: "Incorrect. Multi-Site VPN connects multiple on-premises sites to an Azure VNet. Like Site-to-Site VPN, it's not designed for individual remote worker access."

more: "Point-to-Site VPN connections let individual users connect securely to an Azure virtual network from a remote location. A P2S VPN is a VPN connection from a client computer to an Azure VNet."

Your company has virtual machines (VMs) hosted in Microsoft Azure. The VMs are located in a single Azure virtual network named VNet1.

The company has users that work remotely. The remote workers require access to the VMs on VNet1.

You need to provide access for the remote workers.

What should you do?
