      explain: "Incorrect. Using two virtual machines across two availability zones is the minimum configuration required to achieve 99.99% availability. This setup provides protection against both hardware failures and datacenter outages while minimizing costs."

more: "Azure Availability Zones are physically separate locations within an Azure region, each with independent power, cooling, and networking. By distributing VMs across zones, you can protect your applications against datacenter failures."

You are tasked with deploying a critical LOB application, which will be installed on a virtual machine, to Azure.

You are informed that the application deployment strategy should allow for a guaranteed availability of 99.99 percent. You need to make sure that the strategy requires as little virtual machines and availability zones as possible.

Solution: You include two virtual machines and two availability zones in your strategy.

Does the solution meet the goal?
