      title: "Deploy QUIZVM1 into one subnet and QUIZVM2...QUIZVM20 into another subnet"
      explain: "Virtual machines in different subnets within the same VNet can still communicate with each other by default, so this solution wouldn't prevent QUIZVM1 from connecting to the other VMs."

MDFT Academy plans to deploy 20 virtual machines named QUIZVM1, QUIZVM2, QUIZVM3...QUIZVM20 to the Azure cloud. For security reasons, the virtual machine named QUIZVM1 must not be able to make a network connection to any of the other virtual machines.

You need to design an Azure solution that meets the requirements. What must you do?
