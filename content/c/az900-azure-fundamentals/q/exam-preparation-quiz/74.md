MDFT Pro plans to migrate all its data and resources to Azure. The company's migration plan states that only Platform as a Service (PaaS) solutions must be used in Azure. You need to deploy an Azure environment that meets the company migration plan.

Solution: You create an Azure App Service and Azure virtual machines that have Microsoft SQL Server installed.
