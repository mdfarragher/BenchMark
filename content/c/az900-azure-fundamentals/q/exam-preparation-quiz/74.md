      explain: "Incorrect. While Azure App Service is a PaaS solution, virtual machines with SQL Server installed are considered IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service). To meet the PaaS-only requirement, you should use Azure SQL Database instead of SQL Server on VMs."

      title: "No"
      correct: true

more: "Platform as a Service (PaaS) provides a managed platform for running applications without managing the underlying infrastructure. Azure App Service is PaaS, but VMs are IaaS. For a PaaS database solution, use Azure SQL Database or other managed database services."

Your company plans to migrate all its data and resources to Azure.

The company's migration plan states that only Platform as a Service (PaaS) solutions must be used in Azure.

You need to deploy an Azure environment that meets the company migration plan.

Solution: You create an Azure App Service and Azure virtual machines that have Microsoft SQL Server installed.

Does this meet the goal?
