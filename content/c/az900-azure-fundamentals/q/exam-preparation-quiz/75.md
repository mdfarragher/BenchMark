Your company plans to migrate all its data and resources to Azure.

The company's migration plan states that only Platform as a Service (PaaS) solutions must be used in Azure.

You need to deploy an Azure environment that meets the company migration plan.

Solution: You create an Azure App Service and Azure SQL databases.

Does this meet the goal?
