You plan to deploy several virtual machines to the Azure cloud, and you need to ensure that the services running on the virtual machines are available if a region fails. 

You design a solution with the virtual machines deployed to the West Europe region. You decide to configure an arbitrary secondary region (for example: East US) as the geographical backup location for your virtual machines. 

Is this solution possible in Azure?
