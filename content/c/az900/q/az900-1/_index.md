This quiz will test your knowledge on fundamental Azure topics, like IaaS and PaaS, public versus hybrid cloud, CapEx versus OpEx... basically everything from the first chapter of the Microsoft AZ-900 traininig.

The quiz questions are similar to what you can expect on the actual AZ-900 certification exam. Roughly 25-30% of the questions you'll get on the actual exam will be about cloud fundamentals.
