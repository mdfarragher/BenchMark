You have business dats stored locally on a file server on-premises. You plan to migrate the business data to an Azure storage account. The data still needs to be accessible after a single data center fails in the primary region. 

You need to select the cheapest Azure solution that meets the requirements. Which storage redundancy option should you choose?
