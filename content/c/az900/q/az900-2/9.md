You plan to deploy 20 virtual machines named VM1, VM2, VM3...VM20 to the Azure cloud. For security reasons, the virtual machine named VM1 must not be able to make a network connection to any of the other virtual machines.

You need to design an Azure solution that meets the requirements. What must you do?
