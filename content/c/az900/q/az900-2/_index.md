This quiz will test your knowledge on Azure core services, like blob storage accounts, virtual machines, networks, databases... basically everything from the second chapter of the Microsoft AZ-900 traininig.

The quiz questions are similar to what you can expect on the actual AZ-900 certification exam. Roughly 35-40% of the questions you'll get on the actual exam will be about core services.
