This quiz will test your knowledge of Azure core services. You will be tested on your knowledge of Azure architecture, compute and networking services, storage services, and identity, access and security services.

The quiz questions are similar to what you can expect on the actual AZ-900 certification exam. Roughly 35-40% of the questions you'll get on the actual exam will be about core services.
