This quiz will test your knowledge of Azure management and governance. You will be tested on your knowledge of cost management, Microsoft Purview, policies, resource locks, and Azure management and monitoring tools.

The quiz questions are similar to what you can expect on the actual AZ-900 certification exam. Roughly 30-35% of the questions you'll get on the actual exam will be about Azure management and governance.
