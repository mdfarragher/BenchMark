layout: "multiple"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Total size of all the databases"
      correct: true
      explain: "This metric is essential for sizing an elastic pool as it determines the storage requirements needed to accommodate all databases."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Geo-replication support"
      correct: false
      explain: "Geo-replication support is a feature consideration, not a metric used to size the elastic pool based on workload demands."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Number of concurrently peaking databases * peak CPU utilization per database"
      correct: true
      explain: "This metric helps determine the peak CPU capacity needed by identifying how many databases peak simultaneously and their peak CPU usage."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Maximum number of concurrent sessions for all the databases"
      correct: false
      explain: "While session count is important for monitoring, it's not one of the primary metrics for sizing an elastic pool based on workload demands."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "Total number of databases * average CPU utilization per database"
      correct: true
      explain: "This metric provides insight into the overall CPU capacity needed by considering the average usage across all databases."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that operates multiple Azure SQL databases for their learning management platform. Mark, the Chief Data Officer, has assigned you to optimize the database infrastructure. 

Currently, MDFT Pro has 20 Azure SQL databases provisioned using the vCore purchasing model, which store course content, student records, trainer information, and assessment data. To improve resource utilization and reduce costs, Mark wants to consolidate these databases into an Azure SQL Database elastic pool that can handle the varying workload patterns across all databases.

Which three metrics should you use to size the elastic pool to meet the demands of the workload?
