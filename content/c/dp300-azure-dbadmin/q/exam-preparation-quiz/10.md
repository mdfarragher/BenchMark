You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that uses Azure Databricks for advanced data analytics. Mark, the Lead Data Scientist, has assigned you to create a new analytical notebook for processing student performance data. The notebook will primarily use R for statistical analysis and visualization, but Mark also needs you to include Scala code for data transformation tasks and SQL queries to extract data from the company's data lake. He wants you to use the appropriate syntax to seamlessly switch between these three languages within the same notebook as you work through different analytical tasks.

Which switch should you use to change to the R language in the notebook?
