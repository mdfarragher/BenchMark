title: "Switch Language In Synapse Analytics Notebooks"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "%%python"
      correct: false
      explain: "While %%python is valid syntax in Synapse, it is used for generic Python code. The correct answer %%pyspark should be used when you need access to Spark functionality and the Spark session."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "%%pyspark"
      correct: true
      explain: "The double percent sign (%%) followed by the language name (pyspark, sql, spark, etc.) is the correct cell magic syntax to switch languages in Azure Synapse Analytics notebooks."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "%pyspark"
      correct: false
      explain: "A single percent sign (%) is not the correct syntax for language switching in Azure Synapse Analytics notebooks. Synapse requires double percent signs (%%)."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "%%spark"
      correct: false
      explain: "While %%spark is a valid cell magic, it refers to Scala Spark code."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that uses Azure Synapse Analytics for advanced data analytics. Mark, the Lead Data Analyst, has assigned you to create a new analytical notebook for processing student performance data.

The notebook will primarily use PySpark for statistical analysis and data transformation, but Mark also needs you to include SQL queries to extract data from the company's data lake and interact with Spark tables. He wants you to use the appropriate syntax to seamlessly switch between these languages within the same notebook as you work through different analytical tasks.

[comment]: <> (AI-NOTE: The explanation for answer1 (%%python) is misleading. It states "While %%python is valid syntax in Synapse" but %%python is NOT a valid cell magic command in Azure Synapse Analytics notebooks. Synapse supports %%pyspark, %%spark, %%sql, and %%csharp, but not %%python. The explanation should be corrected to state that %%python is not valid in Synapse.)

Which switch should you use to change to the Python language in the Synapse notebook?
