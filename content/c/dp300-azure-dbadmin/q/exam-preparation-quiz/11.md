You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that operates a managed data warehouse solution on Microsoft Azure. Mark, the Enterprise Data Architect, has asked you to configure Azure Synapse Analytics to load historical course sales data from Azure Blob Storage. The data is stored in Parquet format and contains millions of records about student enrollments, course purchases, and payment transactions. Mark needs you to use PolyBase to retrieve this data and load it into a large fact table called FactCourseSales in the data warehouse. He emphasizes that the configuration should follow best practices for security and performance.

Which four actions should you perform in sequence?
