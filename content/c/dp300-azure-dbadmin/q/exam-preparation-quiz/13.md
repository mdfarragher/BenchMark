You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that manages ETL pipelines using Azure Data Factory. Mark, the DevOps Lead, has configured version control for the company's Data Factory instance to enable collaborative development and proper deployment practices. The configuration uses Azure DevOps Git with the MDFTPRO organization account, connecting to the Data project and the dwh_batchetl repository. The collaboration branch is set to main, the publish branch is adf_publish, and the root folder is /. Mark has asked you to help a new developer on the team understand where the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates are stored after publishing pipeline changes.

The version control configuration is as follows:

| ADF Git Setting      | Value            |
| -------------------- | ---------------- |
| Repository type      | Azure DevOps Git |
| Azure DevOps Account | MDFTPRO          |
| Project name         | Data             |
| Repository name      | dwh_batchetl     |
| Collaboration branch | main             |
| Publish branch       | adf_publish      |
| Root folder          | /                |

Where are the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates for the pipeline assets stored?
