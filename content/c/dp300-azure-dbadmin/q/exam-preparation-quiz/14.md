You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency with Azure Data Factory pipelines for processing student and course data. Mark, the CI/CD Engineer, has configured version control for the Data Factory instance using Azure DevOps Git. The setup connects to the MDFTPRO organization, the Data project, and the dwh_batchetl repository. Mark uses the main branch for collaboration and adf_publish for publishing ARM templates. He has asked you to locate the ARM template for a specific Data Factory resource named "coursepipeline" so that it can be deployed to the staging environment using an automated release pipeline.

The version control configuration is as follows:

| ADF Git Setting      | Value            |
| -------------------- | ---------------- |
| Repository type      | Azure DevOps Git |
| Azure DevOps Account | MDFTPRO          |
| Project name         | Data             |
| Repository name      | dwh_batchetl     |
| Collaboration branch | main             |
| Publish branch       | adf_publish      |
| Root folder          | /                |

Where can the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template named "coursepipeline" be found?
