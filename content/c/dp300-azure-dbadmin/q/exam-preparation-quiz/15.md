    - id: "answer1"
      title: "complete"
      correct: false
      explain: "Complete mode outputs the entire result table after each trigger, which includes all events from all intervals, not just the current interval."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "append"
      correct: true
      explain: "Append mode only outputs new rows added to the result table since the last trigger, which matches the requirement to report only events that arrive during each interval."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "update"
      correct: false
      explain: "Update mode outputs rows that were updated since the last trigger, which is used for aggregations that need to update previous results, not for new interval-based counts."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "merge"
      correct: false
      explain: "Merge is not a valid output mode in structured streaming. The valid modes are complete, append, and update."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that uses Azure Databricks for real-time analytics. Mark, the Streaming Data Engineer, has asked you to build a structured streaming solution that monitors student engagement with online course materials. The solution needs to count learning events (video views, quiz submissions, document downloads) in five-minute intervals and report only the events that arrive during each specific interval. The aggregated results should be written to a Delta Lake table for further analysis by the business intelligence team. Mark wants to ensure that historical data from previous intervals is not re-emitted with each update.

Which output mode should you use?
