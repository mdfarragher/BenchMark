answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "CSV files in the coursedata_2020 subfolder"
      correct: false
      explain: "The BULK path specifies 'coursedata 2020*.csv' which is a file pattern, not a subfolder. It matches files in the csv/enrollment folder directly."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "files that have filenames beginning with \"coursedata 2020\""
      correct: true
      explain: "The wildcard pattern 'coursedata 2020*.csv' matches all files whose names begin with 'coursedata 2020', regardless of what follows the pattern."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "CSV files that have filenames containing \"coursedata_202\""
      correct: false
      explain: "The pattern 'coursedata 2020*' requires files to begin with 'coursedata 2020', not just contain 'coursedata_202' anywhere in the name."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "CSV files that have filenames beginning with \"coursedata_2020\""
      correct: false
      explain: "The pattern in the query is 'coursedata 2020*.csv' (with a space), which matches 'coursedata 2020' not 'coursedata_2020' (with underscore)."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that stores enrollment and payment data in an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account. Mark, the Business Analyst, has asked you to perform exploratory analysis of course enrollment data using an Azure Synapse Analytics serverless SQL pool. The data files are organized in CSV format within the data lake, and Mark specifically wants to analyze enrollment records from the 2020 academic year. You need to write a query that correctly identifies which data files will be included based on the BULK pattern specified in the OPENROWSET function.

You execute the following Transact-SQL query:

```sql
SELECT
	payment_type,
	SUM (fare_amount) AS fare_total
FROM OPENROWSET (
	BULK 'csv/enrollment/coursedata 2020*.csv',
	DATA_SOURCE = 'EnrollmentData',
	FORMAT = 'CSV',
	PARSER VERSION = '2.0',
	FIRSTROW = 2
)
WITH (
	payment_type INT 10,
	fare_amount FLOAT 11
) AS enrollments
GROUP BY payment_type
ORDER BY payment_type;
```

Which files in the csv/enrollment folder will be included in the query results?
