You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency with a dedicated SQL pool in Azure Synapse Analytics that contains student information. Mark, the Privacy Officer, has raised a concern about protecting student email addresses in the dbo.Students table. The table is accessed by course coordinators and reporting staff who need to view most student information but should not see complete email addresses for privacy reasons. Mark has asked you to configure the system so that non-administrative users see email addresses in a masked format like aXXX@XXXX.com instead of the actual email addresses, while database administrators should still be able to view the full unmasked values.

What should you do?
