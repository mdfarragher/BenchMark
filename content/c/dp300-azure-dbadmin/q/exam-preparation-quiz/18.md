    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Upgrade StudentWorkspace to the Premium pricing tier"
      correct: false
      explain: "While Premium tier offers additional features, upgrading alone won't reduce cluster start time. Instance pools are the solution for faster startup."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Configure a global init script for StudentWorkspace"
      correct: false
      explain: "Init scripts run during cluster startup and would actually increase startup time, not reduce it."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Create an instance pool in StudentWorkspace"
      correct: true
      explain: "Creating an instance pool pre-provisions idle instances that can be quickly attached to clusters, significantly reducing start and scale-up time while minimizing costs by sharing resources."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Create a cluster policy in StudentWorkspace"
      correct: false
      explain: "Cluster policies control cluster configuration and permissions but do not reduce cluster start or scale-up time."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that uses Azure Databricks for advanced analytics on student performance data. Mark, the Analytics Platform Manager, operates an Azure Databricks workspace named StudentWorkspace in the Standard pricing tier. The workspace contains an all-purpose cluster named AnalyticsCluster that data scientists use for interactive analysis of course completion rates and assessment scores. Mark has received complaints that the cluster takes too long to start up each morning and scale up during peak analysis periods, which impacts productivity. He wants you to implement a solution that reduces the time it takes for AnalyticsCluster to start and scale up, while keeping costs as low as possible.

What should you do first?
