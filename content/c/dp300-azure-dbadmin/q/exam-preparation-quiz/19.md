You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency with an Azure Synapse Analytics dedicated SQL pool that contains a table named StudentEnrollments. Mark, the Data Integration Specialist, manages a data pipeline that ingests enrollment data files from various course registration systems. These files are loaded into an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 container named enrollments before being processed and inserted into StudentEnrollments. Mark wants to track when each source file was loaded by storing the file's timestamp as an additional column in the table, with each row in the file producing exactly one row in StudentEnrollments. He has proposed using a Get Metadata activity in an Azure Synapse Analytics pipeline to retrieve the DateTime of the files.

Does this solution meet the goal?
