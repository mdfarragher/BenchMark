You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that offers online certification courses. Mark, the Head of Analytics, has hired you to design a real-time analytics solution for the company's learning platform.

The solution needs to ingest streaming data from student activity logs, course completion events, and assessment submissions. The volume of data varies significantly throughout the day, with peaks during business hours and exam periods. Mark requires a flexible solution that allows you to adjust the partition count after the initial deployment to accommodate changing data volumes as the student base grows.

[comment]: <> (AI-NOTE: According to Microsoft documentation, both Event Hubs Premium and Dedicated tiers support dynamic partition count changes. The current answer only marks Dedicated as correct, but Premium should also be considered correct. The explanation mentions both tiers, creating a discrepancy.)

Which service should you use to ingest the data?
