      title: "No"
      correct: true
      explain: "This solution does not meet the goal. External tables in a serverless SQL pool provide a view over external files but do not insert or transform data into StudentEnrollments in the dedicated SQL pool."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency with an Azure Synapse Analytics dedicated SQL pool that contains a table named StudentEnrollments. Mark, the Data Platform Engineer, manages enrollment data files that are ingested from course registration systems and loaded into an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 container named enrollments. The data needs to be inserted into StudentEnrollments with transformations applied, where each row in the source files produces exactly one row in the serving layer. Mark wants to track when each file was loaded by storing the file's DateTime as an additional column in the table. He has proposed creating an external table in an Azure Synapse Analytics serverless SQL pool that includes an additional DateTime column.

Does this solution meet the goal?
