You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency with an Azure Synapse Analytics dedicated SQL pool that contains a table named CourseAssessments. Mark, the ETL Specialist, manages assessment data files that are ingested from various online testing platforms and loaded into an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 container named assessments. The data needs to be inserted into CourseAssessments with transformations applied, where each row in the source files produces exactly one row in the serving layer. Mark wants to track when each file was loaded by storing the file's DateTime as an additional column in the table. He has proposed creating an external table in the dedicated SQL pool that includes an additional DateTime column.

Does this solution meet the goal?
