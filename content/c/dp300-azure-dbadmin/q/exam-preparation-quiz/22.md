You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that operates an Azure SQL database for their student portal application. Mark, the Database Performance Analyst, is provisioning a new database in the Azure portal to support the student course catalog feature. The application has unpredictable usage patterns, with high activity during enrollment periods and very low activity overnight and on weekends. To minimize costs, Mark has configured the database with serverless compute tier settings including auto-pause after 4 hours of inactivity. The database is configured with Gen5 hardware supporting up to 40 vCores and 120 GB memory, with a minimum of 0.75 vCores and maximum of 6 vCores, and a maximum data size of 800 GB.

The database configuration is as follows:

| Setting                | Value                                       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Hardware configuration | Gen5 (up to 40 vCores, up to 120 GB memory) |
| Max vCores             | 6 vCores                                    |
| Min vCores             | 0.75 vCores                                 |
| Enable auto-pause      | Enabled                                     |
| Auto-pause interval    | 4 Hours                                     |
| Data max size          | 800 GB                                      |

After 4 hours of inactivity, how much time does the database require to resume operations for new activities?
