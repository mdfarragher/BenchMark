You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that is provisioning a new Azure SQL database for their course catalog system. Mark, the Cloud Database Engineer, is configuring the database in the Azure portal and needs to understand which service tier he has selected. The database will store course descriptions, prerequisites, and scheduling information with variable access patterns throughout the academic calendar. Mark has configured the database with auto-pause enabled after 4 hours of inactivity, variable vCore allocation between 0.75 and 6 vCores, Gen5 hardware, and a maximum data size of 800 GB to optimize for cost efficiency during low-usage periods.

The database configuration is as follows:

| Setting                | Value                                       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Hardware configuration | Gen5 (up to 40 vCores, up to 120 GB memory) |
| Max vCores             | 6 vCores                                    |
| Min vCores             | 0.75 vCores                                 |
| Enable auto-pause      | Enabled                                     |
| Auto-pause interval    | 4 Hours                                     |
| Data max size          | 800 GB                                      |

Which service tier is this database using?
