You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency planning to deploy a new student portal application. Mark, the Solutions Architect, is designing the deployment architecture which includes an Azure SQL database for student records and an Azure web app for the student interface. For security and compliance reasons, the architecture must meet several specific requirements: the web app must be hosted on an Azure virtual network to isolate it from public internet traffic, the Azure SQL database must be assigned a private IP address for enhanced security, and the database must accept connections exclusively from the designated virtual network to prevent unauthorized access. Mark has asked you to recommend the appropriate Azure service to implement this secure connectivity model.

What should you include in the recommendation?
