    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Business Critical"
      correct: true
      explain: "Business Critical tier supports up to 128 vCores (enough for 24 cores), 625 GB+ memory (enough for 124 GB), and provides the high IOPS (50,000+) required for this workload."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Premium"
      correct: false
      explain: "Premium is a DTU-based tier that doesn't meet the memory requirements (max 84 GB) and doesn't support the vCore model specifications needed."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Hyperscale"
      correct: false
      explain: "While Hyperscale supports the core and storage requirements, it's optimized for large databases and may not provide the guaranteed high IOPS (50,000+) needed."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Basic"
      correct: false
      explain: "Basic tier is designed for light workloads and cannot support the performance requirements (24 cores, 124 GB memory, 50,000+ IOPS)."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that operates an Azure SQL database for their online learning platform. Mark, the Capacity Planning Manager, is designing a solution to handle seasonal fluctuations in database usage. The platform experiences its peak usage from October 1 to January 1 each year when students are actively enrolled in certification preparation courses and completing practice assessments. During this peak period, the database needs to handle 24 cores for processing power, 500 GB of storage for course materials and student data, 124 GB of memory for query optimization, and more than 50,000 IOPS to support thousands of concurrent student sessions. During off-peak periods, the database will be scaled down to the Standard tier to reduce costs.

Which service tier should you use during peak usage?
