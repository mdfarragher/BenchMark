layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "page compression"
      correct: false
      explain: "Page compression provides good compression for row-based tables but is less effective than columnstore compression for large analytical tables with billions of rows."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "row compression"
      correct: false
      explain: "Row compression provides basic compression but is significantly less effective than columnstore options for large tables."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "columnstore compression"
      correct: false
      explain: "Standard columnstore compression is excellent for large tables, but columnstore archival compression provides even greater space reduction."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "columnstore archival compression"
      correct: true
      explain: "Columnstore archival compression provides the greatest space reduction for large tables like this 6 billion row fact table, using additional compression algorithms beyond standard columnstore."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency with an Azure SQL database that contains a massive fact table named FactEnrollments. Mark, the Database Storage Optimization Lead, needs to reduce storage costs while maintaining query performance. The FactEnrollments table has grown to 6 billion rows and is loaded nightly through a batch process that imports student enrollment records, course registrations, and payment information. The table structure includes columns for EnrollmentID (int), CourseID (int), TotalAmount (numeric 8,4), TaxAmount (numeric 8,4), and StudentName (varchar 30). Mark has asked you to recommend the compression type that will provide the greatest reduction in database storage space while maximizing query performance for analytical workloads.

The table structure is as follows:

| Column name    | Data type     |
| -------------- | ------------- |
| EnrollmentID   | int           |
| CourseID       | int           |
| TotalAmount    | numeric(8, 4) |
| TaxAmount      | numeric(8, 4) |
| StudentName    | varchar(30)   |

Which type of compression provides the greatest space reduction for the database?
