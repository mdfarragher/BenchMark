You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency with an Azure subscription used for managing their database infrastructure. Mark, the Infrastructure as Code Specialist, needs to deploy a new Azure SQL resource that will host multiple databases for different business functions including student records, course catalogs, and assessment results. The key requirement is that the deployed resource must support cross-database queries, allowing stored procedures and reporting queries to join data across the student, course, and assessment databases. Mark plans to use an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template for the deployment to ensure consistency and repeatability across development, staging, and production environments.

How should you complete the ARM template?

```json
{
	.....
	"resources": [
		{
			"type": _______________,
			"name": "[parameters('targetName')]",
			"location": "[parameters('location')]",
			"sku": {
				"name": "[parameters('skuName')]",
			},
			"properties": {
				.....
			}
		}
	]
}
```
