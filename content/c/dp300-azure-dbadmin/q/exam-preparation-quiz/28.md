You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that uses Infrastructure as Code for database deployments. Mark, the Template Automation Engineer, has created an Azure Resource Manager template to deploy a database for the student registration system. The template includes configuration for a SQL server and a nested database resource. Mark has asked you to review the template and identify key characteristics of the deployment, specifically focusing on the pricing model and deployment target. Understanding these characteristics will help the finance team budget appropriately and ensure the deployment meets the application's requirements.

The Azure Resource Manager template is as follows:

```json
"variable": {
	"serverName": "mdftprodb001"
},
"resources": [
	{
		"name": "[variables ('srvname')]",
		"type": "Microsoft.Sql/servers",
		"apiVersion": "2019-06-01-preview",
		"location": "[parameters('location')]",
		"properties": {
			"administratorLogin": "[parameters ('alogin')]",
			"administratorLoginPassword": "[parameters ('apassword')]",
			"version": "12.0"
		},
		"resources": [
			{
				"name": "[concat (variables ('serverName'),'/',parameters('databaseName'))]",
				"type": "Microsoft.Sql/servers/databases",
				"apiVersion": "2020-08-01-preview",
				"location": "[parameters ('location')]",
				"kind": "v12.0",
				"sku": {
					"name": "Standard",
					"tier": "Standard",
					"capacity": 10
				},
				"dependsOn": [
					"[concat ('Microsoft.Sql/servers/', variables ('serverName'))]"
				],
				"properties": {
				},
				"resources": {
				}
			}
		]
	}
]
```
