You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency with an on-premises Microsoft SQL Server 2019 instance that hosts a critical database named StudentRecords. Mark, the Migration Architect, has planned an online migration of StudentRecords to an Azure SQL managed instance using the Azure Database Migration Service to minimize downtime during the transition. The StudentRecords database contains enrollment information, course completions, and assessment scores for thousands of students, and it must remain available during the migration process. Mark has asked you to prepare the database backups in the proper format and location so that the Azure Database Migration Service can access them during the migration.

What should you run for the backup and where should you store the backup?
