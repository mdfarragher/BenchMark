You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that deploys Azure infrastructure using ARM templates. Mark, the Infrastructure Automation Developer, is creating a template to deploy a SQL server and database for the course evaluation system. The template must ensure that resources are created in the correct order, with the database resource waiting for the SQL server to be fully provisioned before it starts its own deployment. Mark has asked you to complete a critical section of the template that controls the deployment sequence by specifying the relationship between the server and database resources.

How should you complete the template?

```json
"resources": [
	{
		"name": "[variables('serverName')]",
		"type": "Microsoft.Sql/servers",
		"apiVersion": "2020-02-02-preview",
		"location": "[parameters('location')]",
		"resources": [
			{
				"name": "[variables('databaseName')]",
				"type": "Microsoft.Sql/servers/databases",
				"_______________": [
					"[concat ('Microsoft.Sql/servers/', variables ('serverName'))]"
				]
			}
		]
	}
]
```
