You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency with an on-premises Microsoft SQL Server that stores course materials, training videos, and documentation using FileTables and Filestream features. Mark, the Database Migration Lead, needs to migrate this database to Azure to improve scalability and reduce on-premises infrastructure costs. The FileTables feature allows the database to store files in a hierarchical directory structure with file system access, while Filestream enables efficient storage and streaming of large binary data like training videos. Mark requires an Azure SQL service that maintains full compatibility with these SQL Server features to avoid extensive application refactoring during the migration.

Which service should you use?
