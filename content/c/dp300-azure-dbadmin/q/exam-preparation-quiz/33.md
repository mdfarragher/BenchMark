You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that needs to migrate an on-premises Microsoft SQL Server database to Azure SQL Database. Mark, the Migration Project Manager, is responsible for ensuring the migration has minimal impact on the business. The database contains student enrollment records, course schedules, and real-time assessment data that must remain available to students and trainers throughout the migration process. The application cannot tolerate more than a few minutes of downtime, as it serves students across multiple time zones who access the learning platform 24/7. Mark has asked you to recommend a migration approach that keeps the database synchronized during the migration and allows for a quick cutover with minimal downtime.

What should you do?
