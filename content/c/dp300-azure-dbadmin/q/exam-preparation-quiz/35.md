You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency with an on-premises Microsoft SQL Server named TrainingServer that hosts five critical databases. Mark, the Infrastructure Migration Manager, needs to migrate all five databases to an Azure SQL managed instance to modernize the infrastructure and reduce maintenance overhead. The five databases include StudentRecords, CourseCatalog, AssessmentResults, TrainerSchedules, and CertificationTracking. These databases contain vital operational data that must remain consistent and available, and the migration must minimize downtime to avoid disrupting the ongoing training sessions and student assessments. Mark also wants to ensure that no data is lost during the migration process. He has asked you to recommend the most appropriate migration method.

What should you use?
