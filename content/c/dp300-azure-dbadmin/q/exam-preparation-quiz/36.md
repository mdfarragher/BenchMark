You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency with a Microsoft SQL Server 2019 database named AnalyticsDB that supports their business intelligence operations. Mark, the Database Compatibility Engineer, is preparing to migrate AnalyticsDB to Azure SQL Database to take advantage of cloud scalability and built-in intelligence features. The database currently uses several advanced features including clustered columnstore indexes for efficient analytics queries, automatic tuning for performance optimization, change tracking to monitor data modifications, and PolyBase to query external data sources stored in Azure Data Lake. Before proceeding with the migration, Mark needs to identify which features are not compatible with Azure SQL Database and must be removed or replaced to ensure a successful migration.

What feature should be removed or replaced before AnalyticsDB can be migrated?
