      title: "page compression"
      correct: false
      explain: "Page compression is used for rowstore tables, not for columnstore tables which have their own compression mechanism."

      title: "columnstore compression"
      correct: false
      explain: "While columnstore compression is the default for columnstore tables, it doesn't maximize the compression ratio as much as archival compression."

      title: "GZIP compression"
      correct: false
      explain: "GZIP compression is not a native SQL Server table compression option and cannot be applied to columnstore indexes."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "columnstore archival compression"
      correct: true
      explain: "Columnstore archival compression provides the maximum compression ratio for columnstore data while still allowing the data to be indexed and queried."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency with an Azure SQL database that contains a large table named StudentAssessments. Mark, the Storage Optimization Architect, needs to optimize storage costs while maintaining query performance. The StudentAssessments table uses partitioned columnstores to efficiently store millions of historical assessment records and quiz results. Mark has specific requirements: each partition must be compressed to reduce storage costs, the compression ratio must be maximized to achieve the greatest space savings possible, and the compressed data must remain fully indexable and queryable for reporting and analytics workloads. He has asked you to recommend the most appropriate compression method that meets all these requirements.

What should you use?
