You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency with an Azure subscription linked to an Azure Active Directory tenant. Mark, the SQL Server Infrastructure Manager, operates 10 virtual machines that run Windows Server 2019 and host Microsoft SQL Server 2019 instances for different training departments and course management systems. Currently, each SQL Server instance requires separate administrative credentials, making management complex and time-consuming. Mark wants to simplify administration by ensuring that all SQL Server instances can be managed using a single user account with consistent permissions across all instances. He has asked you to implement a solution that enables centralized authentication and account management for the SQL Server environment.

What should you do first?
