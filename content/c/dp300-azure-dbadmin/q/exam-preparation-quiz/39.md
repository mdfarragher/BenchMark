title: "Select The Disk Type For TempDB Workload"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Local"
      correct: true
      explain: "Local temporary SSD storage (D: drive) is ideal for TempDB as it provides low latency and doesn't impact the VM's IO throughput quota, and TempDB data doesn't need persistence."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Premium SSD"
      correct: false
      explain: "Premium SSD would provide good performance but would consume IO throughput quota and is unnecessary for TempDB when local SSD is available."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Standard HDD"
      correct: false
      explain: "Standard HDD provides the highest latency and lowest performance, making it unsuitable for TempDB workloads."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Standard SSD"
      correct: false
      explain: "Standard SSD would have higher latency than local SSD and would consume VM IO throughput, making it suboptimal for TempDB."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "Ultra Disk"
      correct: false
      explain: "Ultra Disk is expensive and unnecessary for TempDB when local SSD provides excellent performance without additional cost or IO quota consumption."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency planning to deploy a new Azure virtual machine to host a Microsoft SQL Server instance for their course management system. Mark, the SQL Server Performance Engineer, is responsible for configuring the disk layout to optimize performance and cost. The SQL Server instance will handle student registrations, course enrollments, and real-time assessment processing, requiring careful attention to disk performance. Mark needs to configure disks for different SQL Server components, ensuring that the solution minimizes latency for transaction logs and minimizes the impact on the virtual machine's overall IO throughput quota. Specifically, he has asked you to recommend the most appropriate disk type for the TempDB workload, which SQL Server uses extensively for temporary data operations and internal sorting.

Which type of disk should you use for the TempDB workload?
