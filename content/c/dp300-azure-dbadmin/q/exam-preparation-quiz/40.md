title: "Select The Disk Type For Transaction Logs Workload"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Local"
      correct: false
      explain: "Local SSD is not suitable for transaction logs because transaction log data must be persisted and survives VM restarts, which local temporary storage doesn't guarantee."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Premium SSD"
      correct: false
      explain: "Premium SSD provides good performance but doesn't offer the absolute minimum latency that Ultra Disk provides for transaction log workloads."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Standard HDD"
      correct: false
      explain: "Standard HDD has high latency and is not suitable for transaction log workloads which require low latency for optimal performance."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Standard SSD"
      correct: false
      explain: "Standard SSD has higher latency than Premium SSD and Ultra Disk, making it suboptimal for transaction log workloads."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "Ultra Disk"
      correct: true
      explain: "Ultra Disk provides sub-millisecond latency and high IOPS, making it ideal for transaction logs which require minimal latency for write operations."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency planning to deploy a new Azure virtual machine to host a Microsoft SQL Server instance for their student information system. Mark, the Database Infrastructure Architect, is designing the storage configuration to ensure optimal performance for the critical student database. The system processes thousands of student enrollment transactions daily, updates course registrations in real-time, and maintains strict data consistency requirements. Mark needs to configure separate disks for different SQL Server components, with specific focus on minimizing latency for transaction logs to ensure fast commit times and minimizing the impact on the virtual machine's overall IO throughput. He has asked you to recommend the most appropriate disk type specifically for the transaction logs workload, which is critical for maintaining database ACID properties and recovery capabilities.

[comment]: <> (AI-NOTE: While Ultra Disk is a valid answer for transaction logs requiring submillisecond latency, Microsoft documentation also recommends Premium SSD v2 as a valid option with similar low latency characteristics. Additionally, for M-series VMs, Write Accelerator with Premium SSD is explicitly recommended over Ultra Disk for transaction logs. The question should specify the VM series or accept multiple valid answers.)

Which type of disk should you use for the Transaction Logs workload?
