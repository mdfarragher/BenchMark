title: "Resolve Elastic Pool Storage Limit Alert"
type: "question"
layout: "multiple"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Increase the maximum storage of the elastic pool"
      correct: true
      explain: "Increasing the maximum storage of the elastic pool directly addresses the storage limit issue and allows the pool to store more data."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Delete data from a database"
      correct: false
      explain: "While deleting data would reduce storage usage, it's not recommended as a solution since it involves data loss and may not be acceptable."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Remove a database from the pool"
      correct: false
      explain: "Removing a database would reduce storage usage but doesn't solve the underlying capacity issue and may not be operationally feasible."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Enable data compression"
      correct: true
      explain: "Enabling data compression reduces the amount of storage used by the databases, which can bring the pool back under the storage limit."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "Shrink individual databases"
      correct: true
      explain: "Shrinking individual databases reclaims unused space and reduces the overall storage consumption of the elastic pool."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency with an Azure SQL Database elastic pool that contains 10 databases supporting various training systems including student enrollment, course scheduling, assessment tracking, and trainer management. Mark, the Database Capacity Manager, has received a critical storage limit alert from the elastic pool. The error message indicates that the elastic pool has reached its storage limit of 76,800 MB, and no additional data can be stored until the issue is resolved. The databases continue to grow as new students enroll and new course materials are added daily. Mark needs to resolve this alert quickly to avoid disrupting the training operations, and he wants a solution that minimizes administrative effort while allowing the databases to continue functioning.

Which three actions can you perform to resolve the alert?
