You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency with an Azure subscription for managing cloud infrastructure. Mark, the Automation Engineer, needs to deploy a new Azure SQL database to host the company's certification tracking system. To ensure consistent deployments across development, testing, and production environments, Mark wants to use Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) for automation and scripting. He's writing a deployment script that will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, and he needs to understand which parameters are mandatory for the database creation command. Understanding the required parameters will help him create a minimal, reusable script that can be easily maintained.

Which three parameters are required to deploy an Azure SQL database using Azure CLI?
