You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency planning to migrate 10 on-premises Microsoft SQL Server instances to Azure. Mark, the SQL Server Centralization Lead, manages SQL Server instances that support different regional training centers across the country. Each instance hosts databases for student records, course schedules, and trainer assignments specific to each region. Mark wants to implement multiserver administration using master/target (MSX/TSX) jobs to centrally manage scheduled maintenance tasks, backup operations, and data synchronization across all 10 instances. The solution must minimize administrative effort by allowing jobs to be defined once on the master server and automatically distributed to all target servers.

Which SQL deployment options should you select as the master server (MSX) and the target servers (TSX)?
