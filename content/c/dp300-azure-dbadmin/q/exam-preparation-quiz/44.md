You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency with two on-premises Microsoft SQL Server 2019 instances named StudentDB and LegacyReporting. Mark, the Database Integration Architect, needs to migrate the databases hosted on StudentDB to Azure to modernize the infrastructure and reduce on-premises costs. StudentDB contains the current student enrollment and course management systems that need to be in the cloud. However, the LegacyReporting instance must remain on-premises due to regulatory requirements and integration with other legacy systems. The migrated cloud databases must be able to communicate with LegacyReporting using linked server connections for reporting queries that join cloud and on-premises data. Mark wants a solution that minimizes administrative effort while providing the required linked server functionality.

What should you use to host the databases migrated from StudentDB?
