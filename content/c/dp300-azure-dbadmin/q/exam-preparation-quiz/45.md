You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency with an on-premises Microsoft SQL Server 2016 instance hosting a database named CourseManagement. Mark, the Online Migration Specialist, has an Azure subscription containing an Azure SQL managed instance named TrainingCloud. He plans to perform an online migration of CourseManagement to TrainingCloud using the Azure Database Migration Service to minimize downtime during the transition. The CourseManagement database is actively used 24/7 by students and trainers for course registration, progress tracking, and certification management. Mark needs to prepare the appropriate backup strategy that will support the online migration process while minimizing the total number of backup files created to simplify management and reduce storage overhead.

Which type of backups should you create, and how should you store the backups?
