You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency with a SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines instance named TrainingVM that was deployed using an Azure Marketplace SQL Server 2019 Enterprise image. Mark, the License Compliance Manager, has reviewed the company's SQL Server licensing and discovered that the Enterprise edition features are not being used, resulting in unnecessary licensing costs. The databases on TrainingVM only use Standard edition features such as basic availability groups, standard backup compression, and basic performance features.
