You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency planning to migrate an on-premises Microsoft SQL Server 2016 database named StudentRecords to Azure. Mark, the Performance Optimization Lead, has an Azure subscription and needs to create a new Azure SQL managed instance to host the migrated database. The StudentRecords database supports the company's real-time student enrollment system, which processes thousands of concurrent transactions from students registering for courses, updating their profiles, and submitting assessments. The application is highly sensitive to disk latency, as even small delays impact the user experience and can cause timeouts during peak enrollment periods. Mark needs to select a service tier that minimizes disk latency to ensure optimal performance for the latency-sensitive workload.

Which service tier should you use?
