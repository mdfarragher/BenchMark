You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency with a Microsoft SQL Server 2019 instance in an on-premises datacenter. Mark, the Large Database Migration Specialist, is responsible for migrating a 4-TB database named ComprehensiveLearningDB to an Azure SQL Database managed instance. The database contains years of student performance data, course content, video training materials, and assessment results that are continuously accessed by students and trainers around the world. The database serves the company's flagship global learning platform and must remain available during the migration. Mark needs a migration approach that minimizes downtime to avoid disrupting the learning experience and prevents data loss to ensure no student records or assessment data are lost during the transition.
