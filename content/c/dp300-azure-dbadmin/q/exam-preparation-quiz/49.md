You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency with an Azure subscription used for cloud database services. Mark, the Cost Optimization Architect, needs to deploy a new Azure SQL database to host a development and testing environment for the company's learning management system. The database will support intermittent workloads with unpredictable usage patterns - heavy activity during working hours when developers are testing new features, but minimal or no activity during nights and weekends. Mark wants to optimize costs by ensuring the database can dynamically scale CPU resources up and down based on actual demand, and can be automatically paused during periods of inactivity to avoid paying for compute resources when the database isn't being used.

What should you use?
