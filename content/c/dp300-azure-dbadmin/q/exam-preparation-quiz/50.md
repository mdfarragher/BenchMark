answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "You should use the Business Critical service tier"
      correct: true
      explain: "The Business Critical tier uses local SSD storage which provides the lowest latency for database operations."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "You should use the General Purpose service tier"
      correct: false
      explain: "General Purpose uses remote storage which has higher latency than Business Critical's local SSD storage."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "You should use the Hyperscale service tier"
      correct: false
      explain: "Hyperscale is not available for SQL Managed Instance, only for Azure SQL Database."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "You should use the Premium-series hardware generation"
      correct: false
      explain: "Premium-series provides good performance but doesn't maximize the memory-to-vCore ratio compared to Memory Optimized."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "You should use the Standard-series (Gen5) hardware generation"
      correct: false
      explain: "Standard-series (Gen5) has a lower memory-to-vCore ratio compared to Premium-series Memory Optimized."
    - id: "answer6"
      title: "You should use the Premium-series - Memory Optimized hardware generation"
      correct: true
      explain: "Premium-series Memory Optimized provides the highest memory-to-vCore ratio, maximizing memory availability for workloads."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency with an Azure subscription for cloud database deployments. Mark, the In-Memory Database Specialist, needs to deploy a new Azure SQL managed instance to host a high-performance student analytics database. The database will run complex analytical queries that process large datasets of student performance metrics, course completion rates, and learning patterns. These queries heavily utilize in-memory processing and require substantial memory for optimal performance. Additionally, the database handles real-time updates from the learning platform and must minimize latency for both read and write operations. Mark needs to select a configuration that optimizes latency for the best transaction performance and maximizes the memory-to-vCore ratio to ensure sufficient memory for the memory-intensive analytical workloads.

Which service tier and hardware generation should you use?
