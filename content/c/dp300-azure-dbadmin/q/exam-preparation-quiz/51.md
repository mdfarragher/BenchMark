You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency with a Microsoft SQL Server 2017 server that hosts databases for their course scheduling and trainer assignment systems. Mark, the Scheduled Jobs Migration Lead, needs to migrate the server to Azure to improve reliability and reduce infrastructure maintenance costs. The current server uses SQL Server Agent extensively to automate nightly data processing jobs, backup operations, course enrollment synchronization tasks, and report generation. Mark requires a migration solution that ensures the company uses the latest version of SQL Server to benefit from security updates and new features, continues to support the SQL Server Agent service for all existing automated jobs, and minimizes administrative effort so the database team can focus on business value rather than infrastructure management.
