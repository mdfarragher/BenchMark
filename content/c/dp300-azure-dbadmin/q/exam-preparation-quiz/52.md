You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency with a Microsoft SQL Server 2017 server that hosts five databases supporting different aspects of the business including student records, course catalogs, assessment tracking, trainer schedules, and certification management. Mark, the Cloud Cost Optimization Manager, plans to migrate these databases to Azure to reduce infrastructure costs and improve scalability. The databases have highly variable workloads with unpredictable patterns - some are very active during business hours but nearly idle at night, while others have sporadic usage throughout the day. Mark wants a solution that automatically scales compute resources up and down based on actual workload demand to avoid paying for idle capacity, and provides per-second billing so the company only pays for the exact amount of compute used.

What should you include in the recommendation?
