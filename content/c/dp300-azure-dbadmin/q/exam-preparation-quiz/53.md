You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency planning to migrate five databases from a Microsoft SQL Server 2017 server to Azure. Mark, the Service Tier Selection Specialist, is evaluating different Azure SQL Database service tiers to find the optimal configuration. The databases support various training operations including StudentEnrollment, CourseMaterials, AssessmentResults, TrainerAvailability, and CertificationTracking. Each database has different usage patterns with varying levels of activity throughout the day. Mark wants a solution that automatically scales compute resources based on workload demand to ensure good performance during busy periods while reducing costs during quiet times, and provides per-second billing to minimize costs by only charging for actual compute consumption rather than reserved capacity.

Which service tier should you include in the recommendation?
