You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency with an on-premises Microsoft SQL Server 2019 database named FieldOperations that uses merge replication. Mark, the Distributed Database Migration Expert, manages this database which synchronizes data between the central office and regional training centers. The merge replication setup allows trainers at different locations to update student progress, course schedules, and assessment results independently, with all changes synchronized bi-directionally through merge replication. Each regional office can work autonomously even when network connectivity to the central office is intermittent. Mark needs to migrate the FieldOperations database to Azure while maintaining the merge replication functionality that is critical for the distributed operations model.

Which service should you use?
