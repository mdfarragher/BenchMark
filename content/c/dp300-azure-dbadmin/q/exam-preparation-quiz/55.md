You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency with an on-premises datacenter containing a 2-TB Microsoft SQL Server 2019 database named LearningPlatform. Mark, the Minimal-Downtime Migration Architect, needs to migrate this large database to an Azure SQL managed instance. The LearningPlatform database serves thousands of students globally who access course materials, submit assignments, and take assessments 24/7. The database contains course content, student progress tracking, video streaming metadata, and certification records accumulated over many years. Mark requires a migration solution that minimizes downtime to avoid disrupting the continuous learning activities of students across different time zones, and minimizes administrative effort so the small database team doesn't get overwhelmed with complex migration procedures.

What should you include in the recommendation?
