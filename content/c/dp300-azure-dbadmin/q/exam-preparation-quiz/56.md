You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency with an Azure subscription used for deploying database infrastructure. Mark, the High-Performance VM Specialist, plans to deploy an instance of SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines to host a mission-critical student transaction database. The database will process thousands of concurrent enrollment transactions, course registrations, and payment operations that require extremely low latency for transaction log writes to maintain high throughput. Mark wants to use Write Accelerator technology to minimize write latency for the transaction log files, which is critical for maintaining fast commit times and optimal transaction processing performance. He needs to select a virtual machine series that supports Write Accelerator functionality.

Which virtual machine series should you use?
