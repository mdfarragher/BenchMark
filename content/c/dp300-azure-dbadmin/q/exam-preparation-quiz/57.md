You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency with an on-premises Microsoft SQL Server 2019 instance hosting a database named CourseContent. Mark, the Database Replication Engineer, has an Azure subscription containing an Azure SQL database named CloudCourseContent. The CourseContent database contains course materials, training videos metadata, instructor guides, and student resources that are frequently updated by the curriculum development team working on-premises. Mark needs to replicate CourseContent to CloudCourseContent to support a cloud-based student portal that allows students worldwide to access course materials with low latency. He wants continuous one-way replication from the on-premises database to the cloud database to keep the cloud copy synchronized with the latest course updates.

Which type of replication should you use?
