    - id: "answer1"
      title: "First, Add a secondary replica to HighAvailabilityGroup"
      correct: false
      explain: "Adding a secondary replica to the existing availability group won't work because you need to create a new availability group on the Linux VM first."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "First, Create a SQL Server 2019 Always On availability group on TrainingVM"
      correct: true
      explain: "Creating a SQL Server 2019 Always On availability group on the Linux VM is necessary before you can use a Distributed Availability Group."

      title: "First, Upgrade the on-premises SQL Servers to SQL Server 2019"
      correct: false
      explain: "While upgrading would provide feature parity, it's not strictly necessary as Distributed Availability Groups can work across different SQL Server versions."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Then perform the migration with a Distributed Availability Group"
      correct: true
      explain: "A Distributed Availability Group allows you to migrate from the on-premises AG to the Azure VM AG with minimal downtime by synchronizing data between the two availability groups."

      title: "Then perform the migration with Azure Migrate"
      correct: false
      explain: "Azure Migrate is not designed for migrating from an existing Always On availability group with minimal downtime."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency with two on-premises servers running Windows Server 2019 that host a Microsoft SQL Server 2017 Always On availability group named HighAvailabilityGroup. Mark, the Linux Migration Specialist, manages this availability group which contains a single database named StudentManagement that stores critical student enrollment and course registration data. The company has an Azure subscription with a virtual machine named TrainingVM that runs Linux. Mark needs to migrate the StudentManagement database to a SQL Server 2019 instance on TrainingVM as part of the company's strategy to standardize on Linux-based infrastructure. The migration must minimize downtime to avoid disrupting the continuous enrollment and registration activities that occur throughout the day.

What should you do first, and how should you perform the migration?
