You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency with an extensive online learning platform. Mark, the Director of Analytics, has hired you to design a star schema for analyzing student engagement on the company's website. 

The analytics system captures user interactions such as video plays, document downloads, quiz submissions, and forum posts. The data extracts include event categories, actions, labels, channel sources, and various metrics. Mark wants you to create a four-table star schema (including a date dimension) that will support efficient analytical queries for understanding how students interact with course materials.

The interaction data contains the following columns:

| Column name        | Sample data  |
| ------------------ | ------------ |
| Date               | Dec 12, 2025 |
| EventCategory      | Videos       |
| EventAction        | Play         |
| EventLabel         | Educational  |
| ChannelGrouping    | LMS          |
| TotalEvents        | 150          |
| UniqueEvents       | 120          |
| SessionsWithEvents | 90           |

Which of the following statements about the star schema are correct?
