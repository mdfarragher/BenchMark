You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency with an on-premises Microsoft SQL Server 2016 server named TrainingServer that contains a database named StudentData. Mark, the Backup Configuration Specialist, needs to perform an online migration of StudentData to an Azure SQL Database managed instance using the Azure Database Migration Service. The StudentData database contains student enrollment records, course progress tracking, assessment results, and certification data that must remain available during the migration.
