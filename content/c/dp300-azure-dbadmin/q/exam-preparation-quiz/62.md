You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency specializing in Microsoft certification courses. Mark, the Infrastructure Manager, has an Azure subscription and needs to deploy a new instance of SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines to host the student enrollment database. The database will handle variable workloads throughout the day as students register for courses and access training materials.

Mark needs a disk solution that allows him to independently configure IOPS, storage capacity, and throughput to match the exact performance requirements of the student enrollment system. The solution must also minimize costs while maintaining the necessary performance levels.

Which type of disk should you recommend?
