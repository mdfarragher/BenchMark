You have an Azure subscription.

You need to deploy an instance of SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines. The solution must meet the following requirements:

• Custom performance configuration, such as IOPS, capacity, and throughout, must be supported.

• Costs must be minimized.

Which type of disk should you include in the solution?
