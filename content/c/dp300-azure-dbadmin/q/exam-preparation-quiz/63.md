You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that operates an on-premises datacenter hosting a 14-TB Microsoft SQL Server database. This database contains all student records, course materials, trainer information, and certification tracking data accumulated over many years of operation. Mark, the Database Administrator, is planning to migrate the training agency's infrastructure to Azure to improve scalability and reduce operational overhead.

You have been tasked with helping Mark create an Azure SQL Managed Instance and migrate the on-premises student records database to the new cloud instance. The solution must ensure the managed instance can accommodate the full 14 TB of data.

Which three service tiers support the SQL Managed Instance for this migration?
