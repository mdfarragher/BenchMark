You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that provides Microsoft certification courses. Mark, the DevOps Engineer, has set up a development environment in a resource group named CourseDev that contains an Azure SQL Database server named DevCourseSQL. This server hosts an Azure SQL database named StudentDB containing course enrollment data. The schema and permissions for StudentDB have been carefully designed and are saved in a Microsoft SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) database project for version control.

Mark now needs to create a test environment to validate changes before deploying to production. You need to populate a new resource group named CourseTest with the StudentDB database and an Azure SQL Server named TestCourseSQL. The resources in CourseTest must have identical configurations to the resources in CourseDev to ensure accurate testing.

Which four actions should you perform in sequence?
