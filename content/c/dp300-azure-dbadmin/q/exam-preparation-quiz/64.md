You have a resource group named App1Dev that contains an Azure SQL Database server named DevServer1. DevServer1 contains an Azure SQL database named DB1. The schema and permissions for DB1 are saved in a Microsoft SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) database project.

You need to populate a new resource group named App1Test with the DB1 database and an Azure SQL Server named TestServer1. The resources in App1Test must have the same configurations as the resources in App1Dev.

Which four actions should you perform in sequence?
