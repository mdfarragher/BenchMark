You have an on-premises Microsoft SQL Server database named DB1.

You have an Azure subscription.

You need to migrate DB1 to an Azure SQL service that meets the following requirements:

• Protects the confidentiality of sensitive data from malware and high-privileged unauthorized database administrators

• Supports pattern matching for server-side database operations

• Uses a hardware-based encryption technology

Which Azure SQL service and attestation service should you include in the solution?
