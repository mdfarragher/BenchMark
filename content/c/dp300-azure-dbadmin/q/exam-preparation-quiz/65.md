You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that manages an on-premises Microsoft SQL Server database named StudentRecords. This database contains highly sensitive information including student personal data, certification exam scores, and payment information. Mark, the Security Architect, is concerned about protecting this confidential data from malware attacks and unauthorized access by high-privileged database administrators.

You have an Azure subscription and need to migrate the StudentRecords database to an Azure SQL service. The solution must protect the confidentiality of sensitive data from malware and unauthorized administrators, support pattern matching for server-side database operations (such as searching encrypted student names), and use hardware-based encryption technology for maximum security.

Which Azure SQL service and attestation service should you include in the solution?
