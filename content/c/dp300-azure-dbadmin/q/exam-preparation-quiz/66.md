You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that operates multiple training centers across different locations. Each location maintains its own Microsoft SQL Server instance to track local course enrollments and student progress. Mark, the Data Integration Specialist, has identified two critical on-premises SQL Server instances named TrainerSQL1 and TrainerSQL2 that need to share student enrollment data in real-time.

You have an Azure subscription and need to synchronize a subset of tables between the databases hosted on TrainerSQL1 and TrainerSQL2. The solution will use SQL Data Sync to ensure both locations have up-to-date enrollment information, allowing trainers at both centers to see current course registrations.

Which five actions should you perform in sequence?
