You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that has been operating for over two decades. The agency maintains an on-premises Microsoft SQL Server 2022 instance that hosts a massive 60-TB production database named TrainingArchive. This database contains historical records of all courses, student certifications, exam results, and training materials accumulated since the agency's inception. Mark, the Cloud Migration Architect, is planning to migrate this critical database to Azure to leverage cloud scalability and reduce infrastructure costs.

You need to recommend a hosting solution for the TrainingArchive database that can accommodate its substantial 60 TB size while providing the performance and availability required for production workloads.

Which Azure SQL Database service tier should you recommend for hosting TrainingArchive?
