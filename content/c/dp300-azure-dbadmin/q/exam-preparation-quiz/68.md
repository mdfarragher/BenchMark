You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that provides Microsoft certification courses to students worldwide. Mark, the Database Architect, is planning to provision a new Azure SQL database to track student course registrations. The registration workload is highly variable throughout the day, with peak activity during business hours when students enroll for courses, and minimal activity during nights and weekends.

You have an Azure subscription and need to ensure that the database supports automatic scaling of compute resources based on workload demand. This will help optimize costs by reducing compute during low-activity periods while automatically scaling up during peak registration times.

Which service tier should you choose for this database?
