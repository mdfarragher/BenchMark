You have a new Azure SQL database. The database contains a column that stores confidential information.

You need to track each time values from the column are returned in a query. The tracking information must be stored for 365 days from the date the query was executed.

Which two actions should you perform? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.
