You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that provides Microsoft certification courses to students worldwide. Mark, the Application Development Manager, is developing a course materials management application that uses Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2 to store video lectures, practice exams, and digital textbooks. The application needs to allow external training partners to upload new course content for a limited time period during content review cycles, but Mark doesn't want to grant long-term access that could pose security risks.

You need to recommend a solution to grant permissions to the partner application for a limited time period, ensuring that access automatically expires after the review cycle is complete.

What should you include in the recommendation?
