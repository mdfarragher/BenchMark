You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that provides Microsoft certification courses to students worldwide. Mark, the Security Architect, manages an Azure subscription that is linked to a hybrid Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. The subscription contains an Azure Synapse Analytics SQL pool named StudentAnalytics that stores large volumes of student performance data, course completion statistics, and certification tracking information. Mark needs to ensure that trainers and administrators accessing this sensitive data are properly authenticated with strong security measures.

You need to recommend an authentication solution for the StudentAnalytics SQL pool. The solution must support multi-factor authentication (MFA) to prevent unauthorized access and must provide database-level authentication to allow granular control over who can access specific databases.

What should you recommend?
