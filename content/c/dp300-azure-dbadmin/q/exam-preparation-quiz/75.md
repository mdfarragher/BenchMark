layout: "multiple"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "A column encryption key"
      correct: false
      explain: "Column encryption keys are used for encrypting data at rest, not for filtering which rows users can access."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Asymmetric keys"
      correct: false
      explain: "Asymmetric keys are used for encryption and digital signatures, not for row-level access control."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "A function"
      correct: true
      explain: "A predicate function is required to define the logic that determines which rows a user can access based on their campus affiliation."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "A custom role-based access control (RBAC) role"
      correct: false
      explain: "RBAC roles control access to Azure resources, not row-level filtering within SQL databases."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "A security policy"
      correct: true
      explain: "A security policy applies the predicate function to tables, enforcing row-level security so users only see data from their respective campuses."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that operates multiple training campuses across different regions. Mark, the Data Architecture Manager, is designing a security model for an Azure Synapse Analytics dedicated SQL pool that stores student enrollment data, course schedules, and trainer assignments from all campuses in a single centralized database. Each campus has its own trainers and administrators who should only be able to view and work with data from their respective campus to maintain data privacy and operational boundaries.

You need to implement a solution that ensures users from each campus can view only the data associated with their respective campus, while still maintaining a unified database structure for centralized reporting and analytics.

Which two objects should you include in the solution?
