You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency with an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace named TrainingAnalytics. Mark, the Chief Technology Officer, has assigned you to work with an Apache Spark pool named StudentInsights. You need to create a database called CourseData in the Spark pool to store processed student assessment results and course completion metrics. Mark has a specific requirement: the data science team using Spark notebooks and the reporting team using T-SQL queries both need access to the same tables. He wants you to ensure that when tables are created in the CourseData database, they automatically become available as external tables to the built-in serverless SQL pool without any manual synchronization steps.

Which format should you use for the tables in CourseData?
