type: "question"
layout: "multiple"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "JSON"
      correct: false
      explain: "JSON format is not automatically synchronized between Spark pools and serverless SQL pools. CSV, Parquet, and Delta are the formats that enable automatic synchronization."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "CSV"
      correct: true
      explain: "CSV format is automatically synchronized between Spark pools and serverless SQL pools. Tables created in Spark pools using CSV are automatically available as external tables in the serverless SQL pool."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Parquet"
      correct: true
      explain: "Parquet is also a correct format. Tables created in Spark pools using Parquet are automatically available as external tables in the serverless SQL pool."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Delta"
      correct: true
      explain: "Delta format is also supported and automatically synchronized between Spark pools and serverless SQL pools. Delta provides ACID properties and is commonly used for Spark workloads."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "ORC"
      correct: false
      explain: "ORC format is not automatically synchronized between Spark pools and serverless SQL pools. CSV, Parquet, and Delta are the formats that enable this feature."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency with an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace named TrainingAnalytics. Mark, the Chief Technology Officer, has assigned you to work with an Apache Spark pool named **StudentInsights**. 

You need to create a database called **CourseData** in the Spark pool to store processed student assessment results and course completion metrics. Mark has a specific requirement: the data science team using Spark notebooks and the reporting team using T-SQL queries both need access to the same tables. He wants you to ensure that when tables are created in the **CourseData** database, they automatically become available as external tables to the built-in serverless SQL pool without any manual synchronization steps.

Which data formats can you use for the tables in **CourseData**?
