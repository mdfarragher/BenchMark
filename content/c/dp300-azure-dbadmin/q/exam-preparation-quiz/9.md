You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that uses IoT sensors in their physical training centers to monitor equipment usage and environmental conditions. Mark, the Innovation Director, has hired you to design an anomaly detection solution for the streaming sensor data coming from Azure IoT Hub. 

The system needs to identify unusual patterns such as sudden spikes in room temperature, unexpected drops in equipment usage, or abnormal attendance patterns. Mark wants the processed results stored in Azure Synapse for further analysis, and he emphasizes that the solution should require minimal development and configuration effort since the data engineering team is already busy with other projects.

Which service should you include in the solution?
