You have a Fabric warehouse that contains a table named Staging.Sales. Staging.Sales contains the following columns.

| Name           | Data type    | Nullable |
|----------------|--------------|----------|
| ProductlD      | Integer       | No       |
| ProductName    | Varchar(30)   | No       |
| SalesDate      | Datetime2(6)  | No       |
| WholesalePrice | Decimal(18,2) | Yes      |
| Amount         | Decimal(18,2) | Yes      |

You need to write a T-SQL query that will return data for the year 2023 that displays ProductID and ProductName and has a summarized Amount that is higher than 10,000.
Which query should you use? 

SELECT Product I D, ProductName,
FROM Staging. Sales
WHERE DATEPART (YEAR, SaleDate)
GROUP BY Product1D, ProductName
HAVING SUM (>mount) > 10000
SUM (Amount )
'2023'
AS TotalArnount

SELECT Product I D, ProductName, SUM (Arnount) AS TotalAmount
FROM Staging . Sales
GROUP BY ProductiD, ProductName
HAVING DATEPART (YEAR, SaleDate)
'2023' AND SUM Gmount) > 10000

SELECT Product I D, ProductName,
FROM Staging. Sales
WHERE DATEPART (YEAR, SaleDate)
SUM (Amount) AS TotalAmount
'2023' AND SUM (Ã†nount) > 10000

SELECT ProductiD, ProductName,
FROM Staging. Sales
WHERE DATEPART (YEAR, SaleDate)
GROUP BY ProductID, ProductName
HAVING > 10000
SUM (Arnount )
'2023'
AS Total Arnount
