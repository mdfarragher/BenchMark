You work for MDFT Academy, a well known training agency. MDFT Academy operates a Fabric warehouse that contains a table named Staging.Sales. Staging.Sales contains the following columns:

| Name           | Data type     | Nullable |
|----------------|---------------|----------|
| ProductID      | Integer       | No       |
| ProductName    | Varchar(30)   | No       |
| SalesDate      | Datetime2(6)  | No       |
| WholesalePrice | Decimal(18,2) | Yes      |
| Amount         | Decimal(18,2) | Yes      |

You need to write a T-SQL query that will return data for the year 2023 that displays ProductID and ProductName and has a summarized Amount that is higher than 10,000.

Which query should you use?
