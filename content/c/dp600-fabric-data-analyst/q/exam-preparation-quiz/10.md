      title: "When the FILTER function uses a nested CALCULATE function"
      explain: "KEEPFILTERS cannot be used with nested CALCULATE functions as it uses Boolean expressions, which have this restriction. FILTER must be used in this case."

You have a Microsoft Power BI semantic model that contains measures. The measures use multiple CALCULATE functions and a FILTER function.

You are evaluating the performance of the measures.

In which use case will replacing the FILTER function with the KEEPFILTERS function reduce execution time?
