      title: "From the Destination tab, set Mode to Append"
      explain: "Setting the mode to Append will add new data to the existing table but does not enable or enforce partition configuration."

      title: "From the Destination tab, select the partition column"
      explain: "While selecting the partition column is necessary, it cannot be done before setting the correct mode. The mode must be set to Overwrite first to enable partition configuration."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "From the Source tab, select Enable partition discovery"
      explain: "Enable partition discovery is a source-side setting that helps identify partitions in the source data, but it does not configure the destination partitioning."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "From the Destination tab, set Mode to Overwrite"
      correct: true
      explain: "Setting the mode to Overwrite is the first step because it enables the partition configuration options in the destination settings. Only after setting the mode to Overwrite can you configure the partition column and other partition-related settings."

MDFT Academy operates a Fabric tenant that contains a lakehouse named TrainingHouse. The lakehouse contains an unpartitioned table named STUDENTS. As a data engineer working for MDFT Academy, you need to copy data to STUDENTS and partition the table based on a date column in the source data. 

You have created a Copy activity to copy the data to STUDENTS and need to specify the partition column in the Destination settings of the Copy activity.
