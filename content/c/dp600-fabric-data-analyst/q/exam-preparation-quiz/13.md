title: "Identify the Cause of Power BI Model Refresh Failure"
type: "question"

    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Query folding is occurring"
      explain: "Since the CSV files are in a Lakehouse, query folding should be occurring. The Lakehouse provides a SQL layer that enables Power BI to push transformations to the source, reducing memory usage. If query folding was working, it would not cause resource exhaustion."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Only Refresh Complete Days is selected"
      explain: "The 'Only refresh complete days' setting is a configuration option that ensures data consistency. It would not cause a refresh to fail due to resource exhaustion."

      title: "The XMLA Endpoint is set to Read Only"
      explain: "A Read Only XMLA endpoint would prevent writes to the model but would not cause a refresh to fail due to resource constraints. It would simply fail with a permissions error."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Query folding is NOT occurring"
      correct: true
      explain: "Although the CSV files are in a Lakehouse (which normally enables query folding), if query folding is not occurring, Power BI must import all raw data into memory before performing any transformations. With 30 daily-updated CSV files, this can lead to resource exhaustion during refresh."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "The data type of the column used to partition the data has changed"
      explain: "While data type changes can cause refresh issues, they typically result in specific error messages rather than resource exhaustion."

MDFT Pro operates a Fabric tenant containing 30 CSV files in a Lakehouse that are updated daily. You have created a Microsoft Power BI semantic model named **ACADEMYMODEL** that uses these CSV files as a data source. 

You've configured incremental refresh for **ACADEMYMODEL** and published it to a Premium capacity in the Fabric tenant. When you initiate a refresh of **ACADEMYMODEL**, the refresh fails after running out of resources.

Why is this happening?
