    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Read"
      explain: "The Read permission grants access to item metadata only. Users can see that the item exists but cannot access the actual data through any compute engine. This is insufficient for reading Spark data."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "ReadAll"
      correct: true
      explain: "The ReadAll permission grants access to data directly in OneLake, which allows reading Spark data. It does not provide access to item metadata or SQL endpoint data, making it the appropriate permission for reading Spark data while following the principle of least privilege."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "ReadData"
      explain: "The ReadData permission grants access to data exclusively through SQL compute engines (like the SQL endpoint). It does not provide access to item metadata or data in OneLake for Spark processing. This is insufficient for reading Spark data."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Contributor"
      explain: "Contributor is a workspace role, not an item permission. While Contributors can write data and read all data in the workspace, assigning a workspace role when only item-level read access is needed violates the principle of least privilege."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that uses Microsoft Fabric for data analytics. You need to configure OneLake security for users shown in the following table.

| Name  | Required access                |
|-------|-------------------------------|
| MARK  | Read all the Spark data.      |
| CLAIRE| Read all the SQL endpoint data.|

The solution must follow the principle of least privilege. Which permission should you assign to MARK?
