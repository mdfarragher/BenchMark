      title: "Read"
      explain: "The Read permission only grants access to metadata and item properties, but not to the actual data content. This is insufficient for reading OneLake data."

      correct: true
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "ReadData"
      explain: "The ReadData permission does not grant access to either metadata or data content. This would not allow reading OneLake data."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Write"
      explain: "The Write permission grants full write access to data, which exceeds the requirement of only reading Spark data and violates the principle of least privilege."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that uses Microsoft Fabric for data analytics. You need to configure OneLake security for users shown in the following table.

| Name  | Required access                |
|-------|-------------------------------|
| MARK  | Read all the Spark data.      |
| CLAIRE| Read all the SQL endpoint data.|

The solution must follow the principle of least privilege. Which permission should you assign to MARK?
