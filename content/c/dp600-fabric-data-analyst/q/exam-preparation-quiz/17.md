You have a Fabric tenant.
You need to configure OneLake security for users shown in the following table.

| Name  | Required access                |
|-------|-------------------------------|
| Userl | Read all the Spark data.      |
| User2 | Read all the SQL endpoint data.|

The solution must follow the principle of least privilege.
Which permission should you assign to each user? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.
NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

User1:
- Read
- ReadAll (correct)
- ReadData

User2:
- Read
- ReadAll
- ReadData (correct)
