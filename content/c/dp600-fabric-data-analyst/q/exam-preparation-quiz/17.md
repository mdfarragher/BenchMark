You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that uses Microsoft Fabric for data analytics. You need to configure OneLake security for users shown in the following table.

| Name  | Required access                |
|-------|-------------------------------|
| MARK  | Read all the Spark data.      |
| CLAIRE| Read all the SQL endpoint data.|

The solution must follow the principle of least privilege. Which permission should you assign to CLAIRE?
