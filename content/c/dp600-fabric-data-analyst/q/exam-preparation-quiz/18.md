title: "Optimize Slow DAX Query Performance"

    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Yes"
      explain: |
        The proposed solution using NOT (CALCULATE (COUNTROWS('AttendedCourses')) = 0) is logically equivalent to the original query but more complex. It doesn't address the performance issue and adds unnecessary complexity with the negative condition. 
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "No"
      correct: true
      explain: |
        The proposed solution does not meet the goal. Both CALCULATE(COUNTROWS()) > 0 and NOT (CALCULATE(COUNTROWS()) = 0) are logically equivalent and equally slow because they both force the engine to count all rows. The proper optimization would be to use NOT ISEMPTY(RELATEDTABLE('AttendedCourses')) which checks for existence without counting rows.

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that uses Microsoft Fabric for data analysis. Your Fabric tenant contains a semantic model named STUDENTMODEL. You discover that the following query performs slowly against STUDENTMODEL:

```dax
EVALUATE
    FILTER (
        VALUES ( Student [Student Name] ) ,
        CALCULATE ( COUNTROWS ( 'AttendedCourses' ) ) > 0
    )
    ORDER BY Student[Student Name]
```

You need to reduce the execution time of the query. Your solution is to replace line 4 with:

```dax
NOT ( CALCULATE ( COUNTROWS ( 'AttendedCourses' ) ) = 0)
```

Does this solution meet the goal?
