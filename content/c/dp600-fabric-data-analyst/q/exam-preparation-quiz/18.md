      explain: |
        The proposed solution using NOT (CALCULATE (COUNTROWS('AttendedCourses')) = 0) is logically equivalent to the original query but more complex. It doesn't address the performance issue and adds unnecessary complexity with the negative condition.

      title: "No"

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that uses Microsoft Fabric for data analysis. Your Fabric tenant contains a semantic model named STUDENTMODEL. You discover that the following query performs slowly against STUDENTMODEL:

```dax
EVALUATE
    FILTER (
        VALUES ( Student [Student Name] ) ,
        CALCULATE ( COUNTROWS ( 'AttendedCourses' ) ) > 0
    )
    ORDER BY Student[Student Name]
```

You need to reduce the execution time of the query. Your solution is to replace line 4 with:

```dax
NOT ( CALCULATE ( COUNTROWS ( 'AttendedCourses' ) ) = 0)
```

Does this solution meet the goal?
