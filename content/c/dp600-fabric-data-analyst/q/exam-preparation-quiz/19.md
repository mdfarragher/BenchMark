    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Add a managed identity to the workspace"
      explain: "Adding a managed identity to a Power BI workspace is not possible - workspaces don't have managed identities. Instead, the managed identity needs to be configured on the application that needs to access the workspace."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Upgrade the workspace to Premium capacity"
      explain: "The workspace is already using Premium Per User (PPU), which provides the necessary XMLA endpoint functionality. Upgrading to Premium capacity would not address the requirement to use a service account."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Modify the XMLA Endpoint setting"
      explain: "The XMLA endpoint is already available in PPU workspaces. Modifying its settings would only change access permissions but would not provide the service account functionality needed for the app."

You work for MDFT Pro, a training agency that uses Power BI Premium Per User (PPU) workspaces to manage their training data. Your team has built an Azure App Service app named QUIZMANAGER that modifies RLS (row-level security) roles by using the XMLA endpoint. 

QUIZMANAGER currently uses Microsoft Entra credentials to access the XMLA endpoint of the Premium Per User (PPU) workspace. You want to configure the app to use a service account instead of Microsoft Entra credentials. 

What should you do first?
