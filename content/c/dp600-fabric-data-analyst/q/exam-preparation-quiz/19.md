      title: "Add a managed identity to the workspace"
      explain: "Adding a managed identity to a Power BI workspace is not possible - workspaces don't have managed identities. Instead, the managed identity needs to be configured on the application that needs to access the workspace."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Upgrade the workspace to Premium capacity"
      correct: true
      explain: "While PPU workspaces do support XMLA endpoints, they only accept authentication tokens from users, not from service principals or managed identities. To use a managed identity as a service account, you must first upgrade to Premium capacity, which supports both user and service principal authentication for XMLA endpoints."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Modify the XMLA Endpoint setting"
      explain: "The XMLA endpoint is already available in PPU workspaces. However, modifying its settings would not address the fundamental limitation that PPU only accepts user authentication tokens, not managed identity tokens."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Add a managed identity to QUIZMANAGER"
      explain: "While adding a managed identity to the App Service is necessary, this cannot be done first. PPU workspaces only accept authentication tokens from users, not from managed identities. The workspace must first be upgraded to Premium capacity to support managed identity authentication."

You work for MDFT Pro, a training agency that uses Power BI Premium Per User (PPU) workspaces to manage their training data. Your team has built an Azure App Service app named QUIZMANAGER that modifies RLS (row-level security) roles by using the XMLA endpoint. 

QUIZMANAGER currently uses Microsoft Entra credentials to access the XMLA endpoint of the Premium Per User (PPU) workspace. You want to configure the app to use a service account instead of Microsoft Entra credentials. 

What should you do first?
