You have a data warehouse that contains a table named Stage.Customers. Stage.Customers contains all the customer record updates from a customer relationship management (CRM) system. There can be multiple updates per customer.
You need to write a T-SQL query that will return the customer ID, name. postal code, and the last updated time of the most recent row for each customer ID.
How should you complete the code? 

WITH CUSTOMERBASE AS (
SELECT [Customer1D)
, [CustomerNameJ
, [PostalCodeJ
, [LastVpdatedJ
, x = ___________
OVER (PARTITION BY Customer1D
ORDER BY LastVpdated DESC)
FROM [LakehousePOC) . [dbo) . [CustomerChangesJ
SELECT Customer I D, CustomerName, PostalCode, LastUpdated
FROM CUSTOMERBASE
____________

Placeholder 1:
- Last_Value()
- Ntile()
- Row_Number()

Placeholder 2:
- Having Max(LastUpdated) = 1
- WHERE LastlJpdated = Max(LastUpdated)
- WHERE X = 1

Correct answer: Row_Number(), WHERE X = 1
