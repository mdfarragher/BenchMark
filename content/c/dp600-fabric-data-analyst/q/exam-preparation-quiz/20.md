title: "Choose the Correct Join Type"

    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Cross Join"
      explain: "A cross join would produce a Cartesian product of all rows from both tables, resulting in 5 million rows multiplied by the number of sales regions. This would create an enormous result set and is completely inappropriate for joining Students with their sales regions."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Inner Join"
      correct: true
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Left Outer Join"
      explain: "A left outer join would return all Students even if they don't have a matching sales region. Since we know all foreign keys are non-null and each Student is assigned to a single sales region, this join type is unnecessary."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Right Outer Join"
      explain: "A right outer join would return all sales regions even if they don't have matching Students. This is not what we want since we're creating a Student dimension and only need Students with valid sales regions."

MDFT Pro operates a Fabric warehouse that contains the following data.

| Table name      | Primary key                | Foreign key                              |
|-----------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Student        | StudentID                 | SalesRegion.SalesRegionlD               |
| StudentAddress | StudentID, AddressID       | Student.StudentlD, Address.AddressID  |
| Address         | AddressID                  | None                                    |
| SalesRegion     | SalesRegionID             | None                                    |

The data has the following characteristics:

- Each Student is assigned a unique StudentID value.
- Each Student is associated to a single SalesRegion value.
- Each Student is associated to a single StudentAddress value.
- The Student table contains 5 million rows.
- All foreign key values are non-null.

You need to create a view to denormalize the data into a Student dimension that contains one row per distinct StudentID value. The solution must minimize query processing time and resources.

You create the following T-SQL statement:

```sql
CREATE VIEW DimStudent AS
SELECT
C.StudentID,
C. StudentName,
SR. SalesRegion,
A.Address,
A.PostalCode,
A.City,
A.Country
FROM Student C 
_____________ SalesRegion SR ON C.Sa1esRegionID = SR.SalesRegionID
INNER JOIN StudentAddress CA ON CA.StudentID = C.StudentID
INNER JOIN Address A ON A.AddressID = CA.AddressID
```

How should you complete the statement?
