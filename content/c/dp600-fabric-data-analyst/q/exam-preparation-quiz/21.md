You have a Fabric lakehouse named Lakehouse1 that contains the following data.

| Table name         | Column name      | Data type     |
|-------------------|------------------|---------------|
| dbo.publicholidays| CountryOrReqion  | Varchar(8000) |
| dbo.publicholidays| HolidayName      | Varchar(8000) |
| dbo.publicholidays| Date             | Date          |
| dbo.sales         | OrderDate        | Date          |
| dbo.sales         | Quantity         | Float         |
| dbo.sales         | UnitPrice        | Float         |

You need build a T-SQL statement that will return the total sales amount by OrderDate only for the days that are holidays in Australia. The total sales amount must sum the quantity multiplied by the price on each row in the dbo.sales table.

You have the following T-SQL query:

```sql
SELECT s.OrderDate, 
______________ AS TotalSalesAmt
FROM [Lakehouse1].[dbo].[sales] AS s
INNER JOIN [Lakehouse1].[dbo].[publicholidays] AS ph ON s.OrderDate = ph.Date
WHERE ph.CountryOrRegion = 'Australia'
GROUP BY s.OrderDate
```

How should you complete the statement?
