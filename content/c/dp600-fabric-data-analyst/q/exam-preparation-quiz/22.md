You have a Microsoft Power BI semantic model that contains a measure named TotalSalesAmount. The measure converts sales revenue into different currencies based on the currency selected by each report viewer. For example, one viewer might see the amount in USD while another sees it in EUR.

You need to ensure that the value returned by TotalSalesAmount is formatted to use the correct currency symbol.

What do you need to accomplish this?
