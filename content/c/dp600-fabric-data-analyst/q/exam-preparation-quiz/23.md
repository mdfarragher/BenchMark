      title: "Fact tables on the same level of granularity"
      explain: "Fact tables, even those with the same granularity, typically represent different business processes or metrics. Denormalizing these would mix different business contexts together and could lead to incorrect aggregations and analysis."

      correct: true

      title: "Role-playing dimension tables"
      explain: "Role-playing dimensions are already optimized for their specific roles in the model. Denormalizing these would mix unrelated roles together and could lead to redundant data and increased model complexity."

      title: "Dimension tables on the same level of granularity"
      explain: "Dimension tables at the same granularity level are already properly structured for their specific purposes. Denormalizing these will increase model complexity and would not provide any performance benefits."

You work for MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency that uses Microsoft Fabric for data analytics. Your team maintains a Fabric workspace containing a complex semantic model for Power BI reports. 

To improve query performance, you need to optimize the semantic model by denormalizing appropriate tables to reduce model complexity and minimize the number of joins between tables.

Which tables should you denormalize?
