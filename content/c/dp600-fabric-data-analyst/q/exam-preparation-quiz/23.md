title: "Choose the tables to denormalize"

      title: "Fact tables on the same level of granularity"
      explain: "Fact tables, even those with the same granularity, typically represent different business processes or metrics. Denormalizing these would mix different business contexts together and could lead to incorrect aggregations and analysis."

      title: "Snowflaked dimension tables"
      correct: true
      explain: "Snowflaked dimensions are normalized dimension tables split into multiple related tables (e.g., Product → ProductSubcategory → ProductCategory). Denormalizing these back into a single dimension table reduces the number of joins, simplifies the model, and improves query performance. This is a recommended optimization for star schema designs in Power BI and Fabric."

      title: "Role-playing dimension tables"
      explain: "Role-playing dimensions are multiple relationships to the same physical table (e.g., a Date table used as OrderDate, ShipDate, and DueDate). Since they're all references to the same underlying table, they cannot be denormalized - they're already sharing the same data. Each relationship simply represents a different logical role for the same physical dimension."

      title: "Dimension tables on the same level of granularity"
      explain: "Dimension tables, even those with the same granularity, represent completely different business entities (such as Customer, Product, or Region). Denormalizing these would mix unrelated business concepts together, creating a confusing and illogical model structure."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that uses Microsoft Fabric for data analytics. Your team maintains a Fabric workspace containing a complex semantic model for Power BI reports. 

To improve query performance, you need to optimize the semantic model by denormalizing appropriate tables to reduce model complexity and minimize the number of joins between tables.

Which tables should you denormalize?
