You work for MDFT Pro, a training agency that uses Microsoft Fabric for data analysis. Your team has customer churn data stored as Parquet files in OneLake. The data contains details about customer demographics and product usage. 

You create a Fabric notebook to read the data into a Spark DataFrame. You then create column charts in the notebook that show the distribution of retained customers as compared to lost customers based on geography, the number of products purchased, age, and customer tenure.

What type of data analytics are you performing?
