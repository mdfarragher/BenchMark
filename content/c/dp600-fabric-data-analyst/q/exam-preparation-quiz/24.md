      title: "Descriptive"
      correct: true
      explain: "Descriptive analytics focuses on summarizing and describing what has happened in the data. Creating column charts to show the distribution of retained vs lost customers by various dimensions (geography, products, age, tenure) is classic descriptive analytics - it visualizes patterns and distributions in the data without explaining why they occurred or predicting future outcomes."

      title: "Prescriptive"
      explain: "Prescriptive analytics goes beyond describing data to recommend specific actions or solutions. The analysis shown in the question only describes patterns and distributions without making recommendations."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Predictive"
      explain: "Predictive analytics uses historical data to forecast future outcomes. The analysis in the question only shows current distributions without making any predictions about future customer behavior."

You work for MDFT Pro, a training agency that uses Microsoft Fabric for data analysis. Your team has customer churn data stored as Parquet files in OneLake. The data contains details about customer demographics and product usage. 

You create a Fabric notebook to read the data into a Spark DataFrame. You then create column charts in the notebook that show the distribution of retained customers as compared to lost customers based on geography, the number of products purchased, age, and customer tenure.

What type of data analytics are you performing?
