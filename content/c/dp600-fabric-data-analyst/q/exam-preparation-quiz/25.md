You need to create a Microsoft Power BI file that will be used by MDFT Pro to create multiple reports. The solution must meet the following requirements:

- The file must include predefined data source connections.
- The file must include the report structure and formatting.
- The file must NOT contain any data.

Which file format should you use?
