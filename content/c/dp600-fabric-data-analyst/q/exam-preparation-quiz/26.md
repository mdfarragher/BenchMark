    - id: "answer1"
      title: "CONTAINS"
      explain: "CONTAINS is a T-SQL predicate used for full-text search operations on text columns. It cannot be used to filter aggregated results after a GROUP BY clause."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "HAVING"
      correct: true
      explain: "HAVING is the correct clause for filtering groups after a GROUP BY operation. Since the requirement is to filter based on the aggregate result COUNT(DISTINCT StudentID) > 2, you must use HAVING. The WHERE clause cannot be used with aggregate functions because it filters individual rows before grouping occurs."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "LIMIT"
      explain: "LIMIT is not valid T-SQL syntax. In T-SQL, you would use TOP to limit the number of rows. Additionally, this clause cannot be used to filter aggregated results after a GROUP BY clause."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "WHERE"
      explain: "The WHERE clause filters rows before they are grouped and cannot be used with aggregate functions like COUNT. When filtering based on aggregate results, HAVING must be used instead."

You have been asked by MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, to analyze student registration data stored in a Fabric warehouse with the following schema:

| Table name | Column name      | Data type     |
|------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Student   | StudentID      | Int           |
| Student   | StudentName    | Varchar(128)  |
| Registration   | StudentID      | Int           |
| Registration   | RegistrationType    | Varchar(64)   |
| Registration   | StartDate       | Datetime2     |

You need to create a T-SQL statement that will denormalize the tables and includes the **RegistrationType** attribute in the results. The solution must meet the following requirement:

- Return the total number of students per registration type where there are more than two students registered.

You have the following T-SQL query:

```sql
WITH result AS(
    SELECT 
        s.StudentID,
        s.StudentName,
        r.RegistrationType
    FROM Student AS s
    LEFT OUTER JOIN Registration AS r ON r.StudentID = s.StudentID
)
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT StudentID) AS TotalStudents, RegistrationType
FROM result
GROUP BY RegistrationType
_____________ COUNT(DISTINCT StudentID) > 2
```
How should you complete the statement?
