You have a Fabric workspace that contains a warehouse named Warehouse1. Warehouse1 contains the following data.

| Table name | Column name      | Data type     |
|------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Employee   | EmployeelD      | Int           |
| Employee   | EmployeeName    | Varchar(128)  |
| Employee   | EmployeePosition| Varchar(64)   |
| Contract   | EmployeelD      | Int           |
| Contract   | ContractType    | Varchar(64)   |
| Contract   | StartDate       | Datetime2     |
| Contract   | EndDate         | Datetime2     |

You need to create a T-SQL statement that will denormalize the tables and include the ContractType and StartDate attributes in the results. The solution must meet the following requirements:
- Include attributes from matching rows in the Contract table.
- Ensure that all the rows from the Employee table are preserved.
- Return the total number of employees per contract type for all the
contract types that have more than two employees.
How should you complete the statement? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.
NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

WITH result AS(
SELECT
e. EmployeeID
e. EmployeeName
e. EmployeePosition
c. ContractType
FROM Employee AS e
_____________ Contract AS c ON c.EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID)
SELECT
COUNT (DISTINCT EmployeeID) AS TotalEmployees, ContractType
FROM result
GROUP BY Contract Type
_____________ COUNT(DISTINCT Employee1D) > 2

Answer 1:
