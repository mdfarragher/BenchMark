    - id: "answer1"
      title: "CONTAINS"
      explain: "CONTAINS is a T-SQL predicate used for full-text search operations on text columns. It cannot be used to filter aggregated results after a GROUP BY clause."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "HAVING"
      correct: true
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "LIMIT"
      explain: "LIMIT is not valid T-SQL syntax. In T-SQL, you would use TOP to limit the number of rows. Additionally, this clause cannot be used to filter aggregated results after a GROUP BY clause."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "WHERE"
      explain: "The WHERE clause filters rows before they are grouped and cannot be used with aggregate functions like COUNT. When filtering based on aggregate results, HAVING must be used instead."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency. You have been asked to analyze the student Registration data in your Microsoft Fabric workspace that contains a warehouse named TrainingWarehouse. The warehouse contains the following data:

| Table name | Column name      | Data type     |
|------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Student   | StudentID      | Int           |
| Student   | StudentName    | Varchar(128)  |
| Registration   | StudentID      | Int           |
| Registration   | RegistrationType    | Varchar(64)   |
| Registration   | StartDate       | Datetime2     |

You need to create a T-SQL statement that will denormalize the tables and includes the RegistrationType attribute in the results. The solution must meet the following requirement:

- Return the total number of students per registration type where there are more than two students registered.

You have the following T-SQL query:

```sql
WITH result AS(
    SELECT 
        s.StudentID,
        s.StudentName,
        r.RegistrationType
    FROM Student AS s
    LEFT OUTER JOIN Registration AS r ON r.StudentID = s.StudentID
)
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT StudentID) AS TotalStudents, RegistrationType
FROM result
GROUP BY RegistrationType
_____________ COUNT(DISTINCT StudentID) > 2
```
How should you complete the statement?
