    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Configure the Default Mode option"
      explain: "The Default Mode option sets the default query mode for the model, but even when set to DirectLake, Fabric can still automatically switch to DirectQuery mode in certain circumstances (such as when the query uses unsupported features or when data is too large to fit in memory). It doesn't enforce that all queries must use Direct Lake mode."

      title: "Configure the Partition Mode option"
      explain: "The Partition Mode option is used to set the storage mode for individual partitions, but it doesn't enforce Direct Lake mode for all queries."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Configure the Storage Location option"
      explain: "The Storage Location option determines where the model data is stored, but it doesn't control the query mode used when accessing the data."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Configure the Direct Lake Behavior option"
      correct: true
      explain: "The Direct Lake Behavior option controls how the semantic model handles queries and determines whether they should always use Direct Lake mode or fall back to DirectQuery/Import mode under certain conditions. Configuring this option ensures that all user queries consistently use Direct Lake mode for optimal performance with large datasets."

You work for MDFT Pro. You have a custom Direct Lake semantic model named **CourseAttendanceModel** that contains one billion rows of data. You use Tabular Editor to connect to **CourseAttendanceModel** by using the XMLA endpoint. 

You need to ensure that when users interact with reports based on **CourseAttendanceModel**, their queries always use Direct Lake mode.

Which semantic model option should you configure?
