You work for MDFT Academy. You have a custom Direct Lake semantic model named MODEL1 that contains one billion rows of data. You use Tabular Editor to connect to MODEL1 by using the XMLA endpoint. 

You need to ensure that when users interact with reports based on MODEL1, their queries always use Direct Lake mode.

Which semantic model option should you configure?
