title: "Choose the Efficient Data Ingestion Method"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Download the data to your computer, then use Lakehouse explorer to upload it to TRAINHOUSE"
      explain: "Manual data transfer is completely unsuitable for this scenario. It cannot run on a schedule (requires manual execution each week), provides no monitoring or error handling, is inefficient and time-consuming, requires unnecessary local storage and network bandwidth, and is prone to human error."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Use Dataflow Gen2"
      explain: "Dataflow Gen2 is designed for data transformation and preparation, not for simple data ingestion. While it can be scheduled, it adds unnecessary complexity and processing overhead when no transformations are needed."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Use a Spark notebook"
      explain: "While Spark notebooks can handle data ingestion and can be scheduled, they require coding and development skills to write and maintain the PySpark or Scala code. This violates the requirement for a no-code solution."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Use the Copy activity in a pipeline"
      correct: true
      explain: "The Copy activity in a Data Pipeline is the ideal solution. It provides a no-code visual interface, supports scheduled execution, includes built-in monitoring and error handling, is cost-effective for simple data movement, and is specifically designed for copying data between storage systems without transformations."

You work for MDFT Pro, a training agency that uses Microsoft Fabric for data analytics. Your team has forecast data stored in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 that needs to be ingested into a Fabric lakehouse named **TRAINHOUSE**. The data is already properly formatted and requires no additional transformations. The data needs to be ingested weekly on a recurring schedule.

Which method should you recommend that meets the following requirements:
- Runs automatically on a schedule
- Provides built-in monitoring and error handling
- Does not require coding or development skills
- Minimizes costs
