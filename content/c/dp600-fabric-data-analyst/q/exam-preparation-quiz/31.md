You have a Fabric workspace that contains a warehouse named DW1. The warehouse contains the following tables and columns that store course purchases:

| Table name       | Column name   |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Purchase | CourseID     |
| Purchase | ModifiedDate  |
| Purchase | OrderQty      |
| Course         | CourseID     |
| Course         | Name          |

You need to summarize order quantities as follows:

- Summarize order quantities by year and course.
- Include the yearly sum of order quantities for all the courses in each row.
- Include the grand total for all courses and all years.

You have the following T-SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    YEAR(p.ModifiedDate) AS OrderDate,
    c.Name AS CourseName,
    SUM(p.OrderQty) AS OrderQty
FROM [Purchase] p
INNER JOIN [Course] c
ON c.CourseID = p.CourseID
GROUP BY ________________
ORDER BY OrderDate
```

How can you complete the T-SQL statement?
