You have a Fabric workspace that contains a warehouse named DW1. DW1 contains the following tables and columns.

| Table name       | Column name   |
|-----------------|---------------|
| SalesOrderDetail | ProductlD     |
| SalesOrderDetail | ModifiedDate  |
| SalesOrderDetail | OrderQty      |
| Produce         | ProductID     |
| Product         | Name          |

You need to summarize order quantities by year and product. The solution must include the yearly sum of order quantities for all the products in each row.
How should you complete the T-SQL statement? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.
NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

SELECT ________________ (SO.ModifiedDate) AS OrderDate
, P.Uame AS ProductName
, SUM(SO.OrderQty) AS OrderQty
FROM [dbo] . [SalesOrderDetai1) SO
INNER JOIN [dbo].[Product] p
ON P.Product1D = SO.Product1D
GROUP BY ________________
ORDER BY OrderDate

Answer 1:
- CAST
- CONVERT
- YEAR (correct)

Answer 2:
CUBE( YEAR( SO.ModifiedDate), P.Name)
GROUPING SETS ((YEAR(SO.ModifiedDate), P.Name), (YEAR(SO.ModifiedDate)))
ROLLUP( YEAR( SO.ModifiedDate), P.Name) (correct)
YEAR(SO. Modified Date), P.Name
