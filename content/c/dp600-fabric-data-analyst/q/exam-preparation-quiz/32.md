      title: "WHERE GROUPING(c.Name) = 0"
      explain: "This condition keeps only rows where c.Name is not grouped (0) and removes rows where c.Name is grouped (1). This would remove the yearly subtotals and the grand total."

      title: "WHERE GROUPING_ID(YEAR(p.ModifiedDate), c.Name) = 0"
      explain: "This condition keeps only the detailed rows (grouping ID 0) where neither column is grouped. It removes the yearly subtotals (grouping ID 1) and the grand total (grouping ID 3)."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "WHERE GROUPING_ID(YEAR(p.ModifiedDate), c.Name) = 1"
      explain: "This condition keeps only the yearly subtotals (grouping ID 1) where c.Name is grouped. It removes the detailed rows (grouping ID 0) and the grand total (grouping ID 3)."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "WHERE GROUPING_ID(YEAR(p.ModifiedDate), c.Name) <> 2"
      explain: "Grouping ID 2 refers to rows where YEAR is grouped. This is not a grouping produced by ROLLUP, and so nothing gets removed. The query still returns everything: the detailed rows (grouping ID 0), the yearly subtotals (grouping ID 1), and the grand total (grouping ID 3)."

You work for MDFT Pro, where you're analyzing course purchase data using a Power BI semantic model backed by a Fabric warehouse named DW1. The warehouse contains the following tables and columns that store course purchases:

| Table name       | Column name   |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Purchase | CourseID     |
| Purchase | ModifiedDate  |
| Purchase | OrderQty      |
| Course         | CourseID     |
| Course         | Name          |

You've written the following T-SQL query to summarize ``OrderQty`` by year and course, including yearly totals and a grand total:

```sql
SELECT 
    YEAR(p.ModifiedDate) AS OrderDate,
    c.Name AS CourseName,
    SUM(p.OrderQty) AS OrderQty
FROM [Purchase] p
INNER JOIN [Course] c
ON c.CourseID = p.CourseID
GROUP BY ROLLUP(YEAR(p.ModifiedDate), c.Name)
ORDER BY OrderDate
```

You want to exclude only the grand total row, while still returning:

- One row per course per year
- One row with the subtotal per year for all courses

Which WHERE clause should you add to achieve this?
