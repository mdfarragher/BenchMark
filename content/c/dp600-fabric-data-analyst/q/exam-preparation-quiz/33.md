    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Use the Analyze in Excel feature"
      explain: "The Analyze in Excel feature is used to analyze data in Excel, but it does not provide detailed information about column memory usage or column segment statistics."

      title: "Use the Vertipaq Analyzer tool"
      correct: true
      explain: "Vertipaq Analyzer analyzes the internal VertiPaq structure of your Power BI model and provides detailed column-level information about storage and memory usage. It shows which specific columns are frequently accessed and loaded into memory, making it ideal for identifying optimization opportunities in Direct Lake models."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Query the DISCOVER_STORAGE_TABLE_COLUMN_SEGMENTS dynamic management view"
      correct: true
      explain: "This DMV retrieves detailed column segment information for Direct Lake models, including whether segments can be paged in/out, if they're currently in memory, the 'temperature' (frequency of column access), and when segments were last accessed. This granular column-level data is exactly what's needed to identify frequently used columns."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Query the DISCOVER_MEMORYGRANT dynamic management view"
      explain: "DISCOVER_MEMORYGRANT returns memory quota grants for jobs currently running on the server, providing query/job-level memory allocation information. It does not provide the granular column-level details needed to identify which specific columns are being loaded into memory."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that uses Microsoft Fabric for data analytics. Your Fabric tenant contains a semantic model that uses Direct Lake mode. 

You suspect that some DAX queries are loading unnecessary columns into memory, which could impact performance. You need to identify which columns are frequently used and loaded into memory to optimize the model's performance.

What should you do?
