MDFT Pro operates a Fabric tenant that contains a workspace named WORKSPACE1. WORKSPACE1 contains a DATAFOLDER pipeline named DEPLOY12 and a lakehouse named LAKEHOUSE.

You perform the following actions:

- Create a workspace named WORKSPACE2
- Create a deployment pipeline named DEPLOY12 that will deploy items from WORKSPACE1 to WORKSPACE2
- Add a folder named DATAFOLDER to WORKSPACE1
- Move LAKEHOUSE to DATAFOLDER
- Run DEPLOY12

Which structure will WORKSPACE2 have when DEPLOY12 is complete?
