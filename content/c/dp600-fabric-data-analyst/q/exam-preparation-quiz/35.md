      correct: true
      explain: "Deployment pipelines preserve the exact folder structure from the source workspace when deploying to the target workspace. Since LAKEHOUSE was moved to DATAFOLDER in DEV_WS before deployment, PROD_WS will have the same structure: \\DATAFOLDER\\LAKEHOUSE."

      title: "\\DEPLOY\\DATAFOLDER\\LAKEHOUSE"
      explain: "The deployment pipeline does not create a new folder structure based on the pipeline name. It maintains the original folder structure from the source workspace."

      title: "\\DEPLOY\\LAKEHOUSE"
      explain: "The deployment pipeline does not create a new folder structure based on the pipeline name. It maintains the original folder structure from the source workspace. Since LAKEHOUSE was moved to DATAFOLDER in DEV_WS, it will maintain this structure in the target workspace."

      title: "\\DATAFOLDER\\DEPLOY\\DATAFOLDER\\LAKEHOUSE"
      explain: "The deployment pipeline does not duplicate the folder structure or create nested folders based on the pipeline name. It simply copies the items while preserving their original folder structure."

You have been asked by MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, to migrate the contents of a Fabric development workspace named **DEV_WS** to a production workspace. The development workspace contains a lakehouse named **LAKEHOUSE**.

You perform the following actions:

- Create a new workspace named **PROD_WS**
- Create a deployment pipeline named **DEPLOY** that will deploy items from **DEV_WS** to **PROD_WS**
- Add a folder named **DATAFOLDER** to **DEV_WS**
- Move **LAKEHOUSE** to **DATAFOLDER**
- Run the **DEPLOY** pipline

Which structure will **PROD_WS** have when **DEPLOY** is complete?
