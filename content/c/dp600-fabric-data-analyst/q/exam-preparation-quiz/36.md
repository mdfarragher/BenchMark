You have a Fabric warehouse that contains two tables named DimDate and Trips.
DimDate contains the following fields.

| Name      | DataType | Description                                      |
|-----------|----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| DateID    | Date     | Unique identifier for the date                   |
| IsHoliday | Bit      | Used to denote that the date is a statutory holiday |

Trips contains the following fields:

| Name         | DataType | Description     |
|--------------|----------|-----------------|
| tripID       | Integer  | Trip identifier |
| tripDistance | Integer  | Miles travelled |
| dateID       | Date     | Date of trip    |

You need to compare the average miles per trip for statutory holidays versus non-statutory holidays.
How should you complete the T-SQL statement? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.
NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

SELECT d.IsHoliday,
_______________ AS MilesPerTrip
FROM dbo.Trips t
INNER JOIN dbo.DimDate d on t.dateID = d. DatelD
_______________ d.IsHoliday

Answer 1:
(count(t.triplD) / sum(t.tripDistance))
(sum(t.tripDistance) / count(t.triplD)) (correct)
(Sum(t.tripDistance) / t.triplD)

Answer 2:
group by (correct)
order by
