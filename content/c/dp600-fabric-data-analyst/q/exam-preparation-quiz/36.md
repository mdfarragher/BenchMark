    - id: "answer1"
      title: "GROUP BY d.IsHoliday"
      correct: true
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "GROUP BY d.DateID"
      explain: "Grouping by DateID would calculate an average for each individual date, rather than comparing holiday versus non-holiday averages. This would result in too many groups and wouldn't answer the question about statutory holiday comparison."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "GROUPING SETS (d.DateID)"
      explain: "GROUPING SETS with DateID would only create groupings based on individual dates, not the IsHoliday flag we need to compare. Additionally, GROUPING SETS typically creates multiple grouping combinations including NULL groups, which isn't what we need for this holiday vs non-holiday comparison."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "HAVING GROUPING (d.IsHoliday)"
      explain: "The GROUPING function is used with CUBE, ROLLUP, or GROUPING SETS to distinguish between regular grouped values and subtotals/totals. This is not needed for the simple holiday vs non-holiday comparison we want to perform."

You work for MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency. The company has a Fabric warehouse that contains two tables named DimDate and Graduation.

DimDate contains the following fields:

| Name      | DataType | Description                                      |
|-----------|----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| DateID    | Date     | Unique identifier for the date                   |
| IsHoliday | Bit      | Used to denote that the date is a statutory holiday |

Graduation contains the following fields:

| Name         | DataType | Description                    |
|--------------|----------|--------------------------------|
| gradID       | Integer  | Graduation record identifier   |
| pointsScored | Integer  | Points scored in final exam   |
| dateID       | Date     | Date of graduation            |

You need to compare the average points scored by students who took their final exams on statutory holidays versus non-statutory holidays.

You have the following T-SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    d.IsHoliday,
    (sum(g.pointsScored) / count(g.gradID)) AS AvgPoints
FROM Graduation g
INNER JOIN DimDate d on g.dateID = d.DateID
_______________
```

How should you complete the query?
