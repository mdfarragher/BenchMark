      title: "Each Lakehouse's Query Engine"
      explain: "Lakehouse query engines only process steps that can be folded back to the source. Custom steps cannot be folded and therefore cannot run in the lakehouse query engines."

      title: "The Microsoft Power Query Engine"
      correct: true
      explain: "Custom steps cannot be folded back to the data source, so they must be processed by the Power Query engine. The Power Query engine handles all transformation steps that cannot be pushed down to the source lakehouse, including custom formulas and functions."

      title: "The Source Lakehouse Query Engine"
      explain: "The source lakehouse query engine only processes folded queries. Since custom steps cannot be folded, they must run in the Power Query engine instead."

      title: "The Target Lakehouse Query Engine"
      explain: "The target lakehouse query engine is only used for writing the final output data. The 'Added custom' step is a transformation step that occurs during data reading, before any data reaches the target lakehouse."
