title: "Choose the Correct Data Store Type"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "A lakehouse"
      explain: "While lakehouses support dataflows and Delta tables with V-Order optimization, automatic compaction is NOT enabled by default. You must explicitly configure auto compaction using spark.databricks.delta.autoCompact.enabled = TRUE or set the delta.autoOptimize.autoCompact table property. This does not meet the requirement for automatic compaction."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "An Azure SQL database"
      explain: "Azure SQL databases are supported as destinations for Dataflow Gen2, but they do not support Delta tables or V-Order optimization, which are required by the question. Azure SQL uses a traditional relational database format, not the Delta Lake format."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "A warehouse"
      correct: true
      explain: "Fabric warehouses use Delta Lake table format for all user data, support V-Order optimization, and have automatic data compaction enabled by default without requiring any configuration. Data compaction runs automatically when queries are executed, meeting the requirement for automatic compaction. Warehouses also fully support dataflows for loading and appending data."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "A KQL database"
      explain: "KQL databases are designed for log and time-series data analytics, not for general data storage with Delta tables and dataflow operations."

You work for MDFT Pro, a training agency that needs to manage their training data. You have source data in a folder on a local computer. You need to create a solution that will use Fabric to populate a data store. 

The solution must meet the following requirements:

- Support the use of dataflows to load and append data to the data store
- Ensure that Delta tables are V-Order optimized and compacted automatically

Which type of data store should you use?
