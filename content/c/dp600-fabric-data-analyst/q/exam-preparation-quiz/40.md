You work for MDFT Pro, a training agency that needs to manage their training data. You have source data in a folder on a local computer. You need to create a solution that will use Fabric to populate a data store. 

The solution must meet the following requirements:

- Support the use of dataflows to load and append data to the data store
- Ensure that Delta tables are V-Order optimized and compacted automatically
