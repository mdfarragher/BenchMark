      title: "Create a shortcut in the Files section"
      explain: "The Files section is not suitable for SQL endpoint queries because it's designed for managing raw files and folders. To efficiently query data through the SQL endpoint, shortcuts must be created in the Tables section to ensure proper integration with the SQL query engine."

    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Use the CSV format"
      explain: "CSV format is not optimal for SQL endpoint queries because it lacks the performance optimizations needed for analytical workloads. The SQL endpoint works best with Parquet format, which provides better compression, columnar storage, and query performance."

      title: "Use the JSON format"
      explain: "JSON format is not suitable for SQL endpoint queries because it's designed for semi-structured data and lacks the optimizations needed for analytical workloads. The SQL endpoint works best with Parquet format for optimal query performance and data organization."
