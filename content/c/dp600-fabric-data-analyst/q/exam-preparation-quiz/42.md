title: "Choose the correct file format and shortcut location"
type: "question"
layout: "multiple"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Create a shortcut in the Files section"
      explain: "The Files section is not suitable for SQL endpoint queries because it's designed for managing raw files and folders. Shortcuts in the Files section are not automatically discovered and registered with the SQL analytics endpoint or Spark metastore, making the data unavailable for SQL queries."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Create a shortcut in the Tables section"
      correct: true
      explain: "Creating shortcuts in the Tables section leverages Fabric's automatic metadata discovery mechanism, which automatically scans new subfolders and makes them available as SQL tables to both the SQL analytics endpoint and the Spark metastore. This ensures the data from the Amazon S3 bucket is immediately queryable through the SQL endpoint."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Use the Delta format"
      correct: true
      explain: "Delta format is required for shortcuts in the Tables section to be queryable through the SQL endpoint. When the shortcut target contains Delta format data, the lakehouse automatically synchronizes the metadata and recognizes it as a table. Delta provides ACID transactions, versioning, and optimal query performance through its Parquet-based storage with transaction logs."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Use the CSV format"
      explain: "CSV format is not suitable for shortcuts in the Tables section. The SQL endpoint requires Delta Lake format tables. CSV files placed in the Tables section will not be recognized as queryable tables and may be moved to an undefined folder."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, has a Fabric tenant that contains a lakehouse. As a data analyst working for the academy, you plan to query student enrollment data files by using the SQL endpoint. The data files will be in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) storage bucket. 

You need to recommend which file format to use and where to create a shortcut. Which two actions should you include in the recommendation?
