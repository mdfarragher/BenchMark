You have a Fabric tenant that contains a lakehouse named LAKEHOUSE with a Delta table named STUDENT.

When you query STUDENT, you discover that the query is slow to execute. You suspect that maintenance was not performed on the table. You need to identify whether maintenance tasks were performed on STUDENT.

You run the following Spark SQL statement:

```sql
DESCRIBE HISTORY STUDENT
```

Does this meet the goal?
