You are helping MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, set up a lakehouse named **LAKEHOUSE** with a Delta table named **STUDENT**.

When you query **STUDENT**, you discover that the query is slow to execute. You suspect that maintenance was not performed on the table. You need to identify whether maintenance tasks were performed on **STUDENT**.

You run the following Spark SQL statement:

```sql
DESCRIBE HISTORY STUDENT
```

Does this meet the goal?
