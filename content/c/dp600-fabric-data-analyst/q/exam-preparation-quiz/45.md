title: "Choose the Correct Table Creation Operation"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "INSERT INTO"
      explain: "INSERT INTO requires the target table to be created first with the correct schema, which adds an extra step and doesn't automatically match column types from the source tables."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "CREATE TABLE AS SELECT (CTAS)"
      correct: true
      explain: "CTAS creates a new table and populates it with data from a SELECT query in a single operation. It automatically infers column types from the source tables and can join data from different sources (like the warehouse table Course and the lakehouse table Enrollment), making it the most efficient solution for this requirement."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "CREATE TABLE AS CLONE OF"
      explain: "CREATE TABLE AS CLONE OF creates an exact copy of an existing table's structure and data, but the source table has to exist in the same warehouse. Cloning a lakehouse table to a warehouse is not currently supported."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW AS SELECT"
      explain: "Fabric Warehouse does not support materialized views. Only logical views (CREATE VIEW) are supported, which are re-evaluated on each execution and don't persist data. To achieve similar functionality, you would need to use CTAS patterns or scheduled refresh logic."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that uses Microsoft Fabric for data analytics. Your Fabric tenant contains the following:

- A warehouse named **COURSE_WH** that contains a table named **Course**
- A lakehouse named **ENROLLMENT_LH** that contains a table named **Enrollment**.

You need to schedule an automated process that will create a new point-in-time (PIT) table named **CourseEnrollment** in **COURSE_WH**. This table will be built by joining **Course** and **Enrollment**.

Which operation should you use to ensure that the column types in **CourseEnrollment** match the source tables while minimizing the number of operations required?
