answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "INSERT INTO"
      explain: "INSERT INTO requires the target table to be created first with the correct schema, which adds an extra step and doesn't automatically match column types from the source tables."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "CREATE TABLE AS SELECT (CTAS)"
      correct: true
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "CREATE TABLE AS CLONE OF"
      explain: "CREATE TABLE AS CLONE OF creates an exact copy of an existing table's structure and data, but the source table has to exist in the same warehouse. Cloning a lakehouse table to a warehouse is not currently supported."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW AS SELECT"
      explain: "Materialized views are used to store query results for faster retrieval,  but the source tables specified in the SELECT statement have to exist in the same warehouse. Creating a materialized view from data in a lakehouse table is not currently supported."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that uses Microsoft Fabric for data analytics. Your Fabric tenant contains a warehouse named WAREHOUSE and a lakehouse named LAKEHOUSE. The warehouse contains a table named Course, and LAKEHOUSE contains a table named Enrollment.

You need to schedule an automated process that will create a new point-in-time (PIT) table named CourseEnrollment in WAREHOUSE. This table will be built by joining Course and Enrollment.

Which operation should you use to ensure that the column types in CourseEnrollment match the source tables while minimizing the number of operations required?
