    - id: "answer1"
      title: "View the Query Timings tab"
      explain: "The Query Timings tab is not the first step in analyzing DAX query performance. You need to capture performance data first before viewing any timing information."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "From Performance analyzer, capture a recording"
      correct: true
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Sort the Duration (ms) column in descending order"
      explain: "While sorting by duration is important, you need to specifically sort by DAX query time to identify the slowest DAX queries."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Enable Query Timings and Server Timings. Run the query"
      explain: "This step comes after identifying the specific query to analyze. You need to first identify the slowest query before enabling detailed timing analysis."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "Sort the Duration (ms) column in descending order by DAX query time"
      correct: true
    - id: "answer6"
      title: "Copy the first query to DAX Studio"
      correct: true
    - id: "answer7"
      title: "Enable Query Timings and Server Timings. Run the query"
      correct: true

You have been hired by MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency, to optimize their Power BI reports. The academy's Fabric tenant contains a Microsoft Power BI report named "Student Performance Dashboard" that is used to track student progress. The dashboard is slow to render, and you suspect that an inefficient DAX query is being executed. 

You need to identify the slowest DAX query, and then review how long the query spends in the formula engine as compared to the storage engine.

Which actions should you perform in sequence?
