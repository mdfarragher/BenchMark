title: "Identify and Analyze Slow DAX Queries"
type: "question"
layout: "multiple"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "View the Query Timings tab"
      explain: "The Query Timings tab is not the first step in analyzing DAX query performance. You need to capture performance data first before viewing any timing information."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "From Performance analyzer, capture a recording"
      correct: true
      explain: "The first step is to use Performance Analyzer to capture a recording of all queries executed when the report renders. This captures timing data for all visuals and their underlying queries."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Sort by Duration in descending order"
      explain: "While sorting by duration is important, you need to specifically sort by DAX query time to identify the slowest DAX queries."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Sort by DAX query time in descending order"
      correct: true
      explain: "After capturing the recording, sort by DAX query time in descending order to identify which query is taking the longest to execute. This helps pinpoint the specific query causing performance issues."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "Copy the first query to DAX Studio"
      correct: true
      explain: "Once you've identified the slowest query, copy it to DAX Studio for detailed analysis. DAX Studio provides advanced tools for analyzing query performance, including server timings and query plans."
    - id: "answer6"
      title: "Enable Query Timings and Server Timings. Run the query"
      correct: true
      explain: "In DAX Studio, enable Query Timings and Server Timings, then run the query. This captures detailed performance metrics about how the query executes."
    - id: "answer7"
      title: "View the Server Timings tab"
      correct: true
      explain: "Finally, view the Server Timings tab in DAX Studio to see the breakdown of time spent in the formula engine versus the storage engine. This helps identify where optimization efforts should be focused."

You have been hired by MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, to optimize their Power BI reports. The academy's Fabric tenant contains a Microsoft Power BI report named "Student Performance Dashboard" that is used to track student progress. The dashboard is slow to render, and you suspect that an inefficient DAX query is being executed. 

You need to identify the slowest DAX query, and then review how long the query spends in the formula engine as compared to the storage engine.

Which actions should you perform in sequence?
