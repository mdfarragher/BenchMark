type: "question"
layout: "multiple"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "SELECT TOP(1000) StudentAltKey, COUNT(*)"
      correct: true
      explain: "This SELECT clause correctly uses TOP(1000) to limit the results and includes both the StudentAltKey column (the email address) and COUNT(*) to count how many times each email appears in the table."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "SELECT StudentAltKey, COUNT(*)"
      explain: "This statement is missing the TOP clause to limit the results to 1,000 records as required by the question."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "FROM DimStudent"
      correct: true
      explain: "This FROM clause correctly specifies the DimStudent table as the source of the data."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "WHERE COUNT(*) > 1"
      explain: "The WHERE clause cannot be used with aggregate functions like COUNT(). The HAVING clause must be used instead to filter on aggregate results."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "GROUP BY StudentAltKey"
      correct: true
      explain: "This GROUP BY clause groups the results by StudentAltKey (email address), which is necessary when using an aggregate function like COUNT(*) to count duplicates."
    - id: "answer6"
      title: "HAVING COUNT(*) > 1"
      correct: true
      explain: "This HAVING clause filters the grouped results to only show email addresses that appear more than once, which identifies the duplicates. HAVING is used instead of WHERE because we're filtering on an aggregate function."
    - id: "answer7"
      title: "LIMIT 1000"
      explain: "LIMIT is not a valid T-SQL keyword. In T-SQL, we use TOP to limit the number of rows returned."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency. Your organization has a Fabric tenant that contains a data warehouse with a table named **DimStudent**. 

**DimStudent** contains the following fields:

| 2   | 29587      | john@mdft.academy       |
| 3   | 29612      | richard@mdft.academy     |
