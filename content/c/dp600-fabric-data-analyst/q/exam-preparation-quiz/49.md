      title: "df.select(\"age\", withColumn(\"age\").transform(\"int\"))"
      explain: "The select method is used to choose columns, but the syntax is incorrect. The withColumn method should be used to transform columns, and transform is not a valid PySpark method for type conversion."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "df.withColumn(\"age\", col(\"age\").cast(\"int\"))"
      correct: true
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "df.cast(\"age\", selectExpr(\"transform(age, int)\"))"
      explain: "The cast method is not a DataFrame method in PySpark. The withColumn method should be used to transform columns, and the cast method should be called on the column reference, not on the DataFrame."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "df.transform(\"age\", withColumn(\"age\").cast(\"int\"))"
      explain: "The transform method is not a valid DataFrame method in PySpark. The withColumn method should be used directly on the DataFrame to transform columns."

You are working for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency. You are building a solution using a Fabric notebook. You have a Spark DataFrame assigned to a variable named `df`. The DataFrame returns four columns.

You need to change the DataFrame as follows:
- A string column named 'age' must be transformed to integer
- The code must return a DataFrame that includes all four columns

Which PySpark code should you use to achieve the goal?
