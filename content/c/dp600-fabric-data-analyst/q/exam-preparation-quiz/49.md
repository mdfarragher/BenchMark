You are building a solution by using a Fabric notebook.
You have a Spark DataFrame assigned to a variable named df. The DataFrame returns four columns.
You need to change the data type of a string column named Age to integer. The solution must return a DataFrame that includes all the columns.
How should you complete the code? To answer, drag the appropriate values to the correct targets. Each value may be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content.
NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

df. _______ ("age", _______ ("age"). _______ ("int")).show()

Choices:
- cast
- col
- get 
- select
- selectExpr
- transform
- withColumn
