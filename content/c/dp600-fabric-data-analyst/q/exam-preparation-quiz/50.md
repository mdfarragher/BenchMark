You are working as a data analyst for MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency. The academy uses a Fabric warehouse to track their training course sales. The warehouse contains a table named Courses that stores information about their training courses. The table contains the following columns.

| Name           | Datatype        | Nullable |
|----------------|-----------------|----------|
| CourselD      | Integer         | No       |
| CourseName    | Decimal(18, 2)  | No       |
| ListPrice      | Decimal(18, 2)  | No       |
| WholesalePrice | Decimal(18, 2)  | Yes      |
| AgentPrice     | Decimal(18, 2)  | Yes      |

Your manager has asked you to write a T-SQL query that will return the following columns to help analyze course pricing.

| Name | Description |
|------|------------|
| CourseID | Return the CourseID value |
| HighestPrice | Returns the highest value from ListPrice, WholesalePrice and AgentPrice |
| TradePrice | Returns AgentPrice if present, otherwise returns WholesalePrice if present, otherwise returns ListPrice |

You have the following T-SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    CourseID, 
    ________________ (ListPrice, WholesalePrice, AgentPrice) AS HighestPrice
FROM Courses
```

How should you complete the query?
