      title: "Create a transformation dataflow that will apply all the necessary data transformations"
      explain: "Transformation dataflows may involve complex processing that increases refresh time and risk of failure, making them unsuitable when source access is limited to a short window."

      title: "Create a linked table that will reference the data from another dataflow"
      explain: "A linked table only reuses data already extracted, it doesnâ€™t help with initial extraction from a source with a restricted time window"
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Create a shared dataset that can be reused by multiple Power BI reports"
      explain: "Shared datasets support reuse at the reporting layer but do not extract or stage source data, and they still require scheduled refresh that may fall outside the limited access window."

      title: "Create a staging dataflow that will only copy the data from the source as-is"
      correct: true

MDFT Pro operates a Fabric workspace containing a Microsoft Power BI report named StudentReport. The organization does not currently have an enterprise data warehouse. 

You need to set up a dataflow to bring data into a Power BI semantic model. However, you notice that access to one of the data sources is restricted to a very short time window.

How should you configure the dataflow?
