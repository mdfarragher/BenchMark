You have a Fabric workspace that contains a Microsoft Power BI report named Report1. Your organization does not currently have an enterprise data warehouse. You need to leverage dataflows to bring data into a Power BI semantic model. You notice that access to one of the data sources is restricted to narrow time windows.
What should you do?
A. Create a transformation dataflow that will apply all the necessary data transformations.
B. Create a linked table that will reference the data from another dataflow.
C. Create a shared dataset that can be reused by multiple Power BI reports.
D. Create a staging dataflow that will only copy the data from the source as-is. (correct)
