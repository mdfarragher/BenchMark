      title: "Users can edit data models in the Power BI service"
      explain: "This setting controls whether users can modify data models directly in the Power BI service, but it does not affect XMLA endpoint connectivity. XMLA endpoints require a Premium license, which is controlled by the license mode setting."

      title: "Enforce strict access control for all data connection types"
