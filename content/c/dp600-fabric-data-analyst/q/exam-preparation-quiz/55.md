You are working as a data analyst for MDFT Pro. Your team is analyzing student performance data in a Fabric notebook to identify trends in certification exam results.

You have a Spark DataFrame assigned to a variable named ``df`` that contains the student performance metrics. You need to use the Chart view in the notebook to explore this data manually and create visualizations for your team's presentation.
