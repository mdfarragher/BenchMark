    - id: "answer1"
      title: "For MDFT_CAPACITY, create a managed private endpoint"
      explain: "Managed private endpoints provide secure, private connectivity to services like Azure SQL or Azure Storage, but have no role in publishing models from Tabular Editor."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "For ACADEMY_WS, enable Git integration"
      explain: "Git integration is used for version control and collaboration, but it does not enable direct publishing from Tabular Editor to Fabric. XMLA endpoints are required for this functionality"
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "For MDFT_CAPACITY, set XMLA Endpoint to Read Write"
      correct: true
      explain: "To publish changes from Tabular Editor, you need write access to the semantic model via the XMLA endpoint. This setting is configured at the capacity level. Setting XMLA Endpoint to 'Read Write' enables tools like Tabular Editor to both read and modify semantic models in workspaces assigned to that capacity."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "For STUDENTMODEL, enable external sharing"
      explain: "External sharing is a workspace-level feature that lets you share items with external users. It doesn't affect model development or how tools like Tabular Editor connect to semantic models."

MDFT Pro has a Fabric workspace named **ACADEMY_WS** that is assigned to a Fabric capacity named **MDFT_CAPACITY**. During initial setup, the capacity administrator configured several security settings: 

- Set up a Git repository for the workspace
- Create an Azure virtual network for secure data ingestion
- Disable the XMLA endpoint
- Restricted external sharing to internal users only.

As a data analyst working for MDFT Pro, you create a semantic model named **STUDENTMODEL** and deploy it to **ACADEMY_WS**.

You need to publish changes to **STUDENTMODEL** directly from Tabular Editor. What should you do?
