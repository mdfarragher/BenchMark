      title: "For ACADEMY_WS, create a managed private endpoint"
      explain: "Managed private endpoints are configured at the capacity level, not the workspace level. They provide secure, private connectivity to services like Azure SQL or Azure Storage, but have no role in publishing models from Tabular Editor."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "For ACADEMY_WS, enable Git integration"
      explain: "Git integration is used for version control and collaboration, but it does not enable direct publishing from Tabular Editor to Fabric. XMLA endpoints are required for this functionality"

      title: "For MDFT_CAPACITY, set XMLA Endpoint to Read Write"
      correct: true
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "For STUDENTMODEL, enable external sharing"
      explain: "External sharing is a workspace-level feature that lets you share items with external users. It doesn't affect model development or how tools like Tabular Editor connect to semantic models."

MDFT Academy has a Fabric workspace named ACADEMY_WS that is assigned to a newly created Fabric capacity named MDFT_CAPACITY. As a data analyst working for MDFT Academy, you create a semantic model named STUDENTMODEL and deploy it to ACADEMY_WS. 

You need to publish changes to STUDENTMODEL directly from Tabular Editor. What should you do?
