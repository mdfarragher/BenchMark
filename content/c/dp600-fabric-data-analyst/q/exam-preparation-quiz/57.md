      explain: "Using ISEMPTY(RELATEDTABLE('Order Item')) would return customers with no orders, which is the opposite of what the original query is trying to achieve. The original query uses COUNTROWS to find customers with at least one order."

You work for MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency. The academy uses a Fabric tenant that contains a semantic model named STUDENTMODEL to track student enrollments and course registrations. You discover that the following query performs slowly against STUDENTMODEL when generating reports for active students:

```dax
EVALUATE
    FILTER (
        VALUES ( Customer[Customer Name] ),
        CALCULATE ( COUNTROWS ( 'Order Item' ) ) > 0
    )
    ORDER BY Customer[Customer Name]
```

You need to reduce the execution time of the query to improve report generation performance. You decide to replace line 4 with the following code:

```dax
ISEMPTY ( RELATEDTABLE ( 'Order Item' ) )
```

Does this meet the goal?
