title: "Choose the correct T-SQL statement"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "UPDATE"
      explain: "UPDATE alone cannot handle new student records that don't yet exist in the dimension table. You would need both UPDATE and INSERT statements (or preferably MERGE) to properly maintain a Type 1 SCD."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "MERGE"
      correct: true
      explain: "The MERGE statement can perform INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations in a single statement based on matching conditions. For Type 1 SCDs, MERGE efficiently updates existing records when they match and inserts new records when they don't, minimizing resource usage compared to separate UPDATE and INSERT statements."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "TRUNCATE TABLE and INSERT"
      explain: "TRUNCATE TABLE and INSERT would delete all existing student enrollment data and reload everything, This statement is more suited for refreshing entire tables rather than updating specific student enrollment records."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "CREATE TABLE AS SELECT"
      explain: "CREATE TABLE AS SELECT would create a new table with the selected student data. This statement is more suited for creating new tables rather than updating specific student enrollment records."

MDFT Pro has a Fabric tenant that contains a data warehouse for tracking student enrollment history. As a data analyst at MDFT Pro, you need to load rows into a large Type 1 slowly changing dimension (SCD) that tracks student status changes. 

The solution must minimize resource usage to ensure efficient processing of the student data. Which T-SQL statement should you use?
