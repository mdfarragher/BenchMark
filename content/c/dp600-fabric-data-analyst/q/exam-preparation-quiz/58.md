MDFT Pro has a Fabric tenant that contains a data warehouse for tracking student enrollment history. As a data analyst at MDFT Pro, you need to load rows into a large Type 1 slowly changing dimension (SCD) that tracks student status changes. 

The solution must minimize resource usage to ensure efficient processing of the student data. Which T-SQL statement should you use?
