You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that uses Microsoft Fabric for data analytics. Your Fabric tenant contains a lakehouse named CourseHouse. The lakehouse contains a Delta table that has one million Parquet files. 

You need to remove files that were NOT referenced by the table during the past 30 days. The solution must ensure that the transaction log remains consistent, and the ACID properties of the table are maintained.
