answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "From OneLake file explorer, delete the files"
      explain: "Manually deleting files through the file explorer bypasses the Delta Lake transaction log, which can lead to data inconsistency and violates ACID properties"
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Run the OPTIMIZE command and specify the Z-order parameter"
      explain: "The OPTIMIZE command with Z-order is used to improve query performance by co-locating related data, not for removing unused files"
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Run the OPTIMIZE command and specify the V-order parameter"
      explain: "The OPTIMIZE command with V-order is used for data organization and performance optimization, not for removing unused files"
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Run the VACUUM command"
      correct: true
      explain: "The VACUUM command removes files that are no longer referenced by a Delta table's transaction log, freeing up storage space. It maintains ACID properties by only removing files that are older than the retention threshold (default 7 days). This is the safe, transaction-consistent way to clean up unused files in Delta tables."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that uses Microsoft Fabric for data analytics. Your Fabric tenant contains a lakehouse named **CourseHouse**. The lakehouse contains a Delta table that has one million Parquet files.

You need to remove old Parquet files that contain historic data that is at least 30 days old and no longer being referenced by the current table version. The solution must ensure that the transaction log remains consistent, and the ACID properties of the table are maintained.

What should you do?
