      title: "DirectQuery"
      correct: true
      explain: "When a semantic model connects to a Fabric warehouse with RLS, DirectQuery mode is used to ensure security is enforced at the source. Each query is passed directly to the warehouse where RLS filters are applied, ensuring trainers only see data for their assigned students. Import and Direct Lake modes cannot enforce source-level RLS."

    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Dual"
      explain: "Dual mode enables switching between Import and DirectQuery for performance, but when RLS is enforced at the source, only DirectQuery is used to preserve security."

    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Direct Lake"
      explain: "Direct Lake mode does not support warehouse-level (SQL Analytics Endpoint) RLS. When RLS is defined at the warehouse level, Direct Lake automatically falls back to DirectQuery mode to enforce security at the source."

    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Import"
      explain: "Import mode stores data in-memory and cannot enforce row-level security defined in the source system, such as a Fabric warehouse."

You work as a data analyst for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency. The academy has a Fabric tenant that contains a warehouse for storing student enrollment data. The warehouse uses row-level security (RLS) to ensure trainers can only access data for their assigned students. 

You create a semantic model that uses the student enrollment data tables and RLS of the warehouse. When trainers interact with a report built from the model, which mode will be used by the DAX queries?
