You work as a data analyst for MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency. The academy has a Fabric tenant that contains a warehouse for storing student enrollment data. The warehouse uses row-level security (RLS) to ensure trainers can only access data for their assigned students. 

You create a semantic model that uses the student enrollment data tables and RLS of the warehouse. When trainers interact with a report built from the model, which mode will be used by the DAX queries?
