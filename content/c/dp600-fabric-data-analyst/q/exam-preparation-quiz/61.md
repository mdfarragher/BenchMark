    - id: answer1
      title: "T-SQL"
      explain: "While Azure Synapse Analytics does support the PREDICT function in T-SQL, Microsoft Fabric does not. And in Fabric notebooks, T-SQL is not available and model scoring requires Spark-based languages such as PySpark or Spark SQL."

      title: "DAX"
      explain: "DAX cannot be used with the PREDICT function in a Fabric notebook. While DAX is used for calculations in Fabric's Power BI datasets, it does not support machine learning model scoring."

MDFT Pro has a Fabric tenant that contains a machine learning model registered in a Fabric workspace. 

You need to use the model to generate predictions by using the PREDICT function in a Fabric notebook. Which two languages can you use to perform model scoring?
