title: "Which Languages Can You Use With The PREDICT Function?"
type: "question"
layout: "multiple"
answers:
    - id: answer1
      title: "T-SQL"
      explain: "While Azure Synapse Analytics does support the PREDICT function in T-SQL, Microsoft Fabric does not. And in Fabric notebooks, T-SQL is not available and model scoring requires Spark-based languages such as PySpark or Spark SQL."

    - id: answer2
      title: "DAX"
      explain: "DAX cannot be used with the PREDICT function in a Fabric notebook. While DAX is used for calculations in Fabric's Power BI datasets, it does not support machine learning model scoring."

    - id: answer3
      title: "Spark SQL"
      correct: true
      explain: "Spark SQL is fully supported in Fabric notebooks for model scoring with the PREDICT function. It provides a declarative SQL interface to work with machine learning models in the Spark environment."

    - id: answer4
      title: "PySpark"
      correct: true
      explain: "PySpark is the Python API for Apache Spark and is fully supported in Fabric notebooks. It allows you to use the PREDICT function to score machine learning models using Python syntax within the Spark framework."

MDFT Pro has a Fabric tenant that contains a machine learning model registered in a Fabric workspace. 

You need to use the model to generate predictions by using the `PREDICT` function in a Fabric notebook. Which two languages can you use to perform model scoring?
