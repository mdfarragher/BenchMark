    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Enable automatic page refresh"
      explain: "While automatic page refresh can help with data freshness, it does not address the rendering performance issue. In fact, it adds overhead by periodically reloading data and re-rendering visuals, which could further impact performance."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Optimize the DAX query of Enrollments By Date by using DAX Studio"
      explain: "The DAX query time is only 27ms, which is negligible compared to the 'Other' duration of 1047ms. The performance bottleneck is not in the data retrieval but in the visual processing overhead."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Change the visual type of Enrollments By Date"
      explain: "The visual display time of 39ms indicates efficient visual rendering. The main performance issue lies in the 'Other' category (1047ms), which represents layout calculations and visual interaction overhead, not the visual type itself."

      title: "Reduce the number of visuals in STUDENTREPORT"
      correct: true
      explain: "The 'Other' duration of 1047ms represents layout calculations, visual interaction overhead, and cross-visual filtering. This overhead grows with the number of visuals on the page. Reducing the number of visuals will significantly decrease the 'Other' category duration and provide the greatest reduction in overall rendering time."

You are analyzing a Microsoft Power BI report at MDFT Pro named **STUDENTREPORT** that uses a Fabric semantic model. Users have reported that **STUDENTREPORT** loads slowly during training sessions.

After opening Performance Analyzer, you identify that a visual named **Enrollments By Date** is the slowest to render. The duration breakdown for **Enrollments By Date** shows the following metrics:

| Name           | Duration (ms) |
|----------------|---------------|
| DAX query      | 27           |
| Visual display | 39           |
| Other          | 1047         |

What will provide the greatest reduction in the rendering duration of **STUDENTREPORT**?
