You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency. You have a Fabric warehouse that contains a table named Enrollments with the following columns:

| Name        | Data type      | Nullable |
|-------------|---------------|----------|
| CourseID     | Integer       | No       |
| StudentID  | Integer       | No       |
| EnrollmentDate   | Date          | No       |

You need to write a T-SQL query that will return the following columns:

- CourseID: returns CourseID
- StudentID: returns StudentID
- PeriodDate: returns a date representing the first day of the month for EnrollmentDate

You have the following T-SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    CourseID,
    StudentID, 
    _______ (month, EnrollmentDate) AS PeriodDate
FROM Enrollments
```

How should you complete the query?
