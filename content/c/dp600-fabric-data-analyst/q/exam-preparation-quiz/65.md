      correct: true
      explain: "When a PBIR file uses byPath to reference a local semantic model, Power BI Desktop opens both the report and the semantic model together. The semantic model opens in full edit mode, allowing complete modification of tables, relationships, measures, and data model properties alongside the report development."

      title: "The semantic model can only be referenced using byConnection in a PBIR file"
      explain: "PBIR files can reference semantic models using either byPath (local files) or byConnection (Fabric Workspace items). The JSON shows a byPath reference being used successfully."
