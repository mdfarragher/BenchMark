title: "Complete The T-SQL Query To Convert Assessment Scores"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "CONVERT(int, assessment_score)"
      explain: "Using CONVERT will raise an error when encountering non-numeric values like 'Incomplete' or 'N/A', causing the query to fail rather than returning NULL for invalid values."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "CAST(assessment_score AS int)"
      explain: "CAST will raise an error when it encounters non-numeric values, causing the entire query to fail instead of returning NULL for values that cannot be converted."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "TRY_CAST(assessment_score AS int)"
      correct: true
      explain: "TRY_CAST attempts to convert a value to the specified data type and returns NULL if the conversion fails. For numeric scores like '85' or '92', it returns the integer value. For non-numeric entries like 'Incomplete' or 'N/A', it gracefully returns NULL without causing an error, which meets the requirement exactly."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "SELECT(assessment_score AS int)"
      explain: "SELECT is not a conversion function. It is used to retrieve data from tables, not to convert data types. This syntax is invalid and will cause a SQL error."

You are working with a Microsoft Fabric warehouse at MDFT Pro that contains a table named **StudentAssessments**. The table contains the following columns:

| Column name       | Data type   |
|-------------------|-------------|
| student_id        | Integer     |
| assessment_name   | varchar(50) |
| assessment_score  | varchar(20) |

The assessment_score column contains numeric scores like '85', '92', etc., but also contains text values like 'Incomplete', 'N/A', or 'Pending' for students who haven't completed their assessments.

You need to complete a T-SQL statement that meets these requirements:

- Output the student ID
- Output the assessment score as an integer, but return NULL for non-numeric values

You have the following T-SQL query:

```sql
SELECT
    student_id AS studentID,
    __________ AS score
FROM StudentAssessments
```
How should you complete the query?
