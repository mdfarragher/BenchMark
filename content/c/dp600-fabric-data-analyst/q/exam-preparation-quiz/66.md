      title: "CONVERT(varchar(20), course_name)"
      explain: "Using CONVERT with varchar(20) will truncate strings longer than 20 characters instead of returning NULL as required"
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "CONVERT(varchar(max), course_name)"
      explain: "Using CONVERT with varchar(max) will not handle strings longer than 20 characters as required, and will never return NULL"
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "TRY_CAST(course_name AS varchar(20))"
      correct: true
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "CAST(course_name AS varchar(20))"
      explain: "While CAST converts the value to the target type, it will truncate strings longer than 20 characters or raise an error in contexts where truncation isn't allowed (such as inserts or assignments). It does not return NULL, which is required in this scenario"

You are working with a Microsoft Fabric warehouse at MDFT Academy that contains a table named Enrollments. The table contains the following columns:

| Column name      | Data type   |
|-----------------|-------------|
| course_id         | Integer     |
| course_name       | varchar(50) |
| enrollment_date   | Datetime    |

You need to complete a T-SQL statement that meets these requirements:

- Output the course ID
- Output the course name, but return NULL if the name is longer than 20 characters

You have the following T-SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    course_id AS courseID,
    __________ AS courseName
FROM Enrollments
```
How should you complete the query?
