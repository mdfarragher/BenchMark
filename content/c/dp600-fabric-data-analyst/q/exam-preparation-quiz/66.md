You have a Fabric warehouse that contains a table named Table1. Table1 contains the following data.

| Column name      | Data type   |
|-----------------|-------------|
| item_id         | Integer     |
| item_name       | varchar(50) |
| item_description| varchar(50) |
| purchase_date   | Datetime    |

You need to create a T-SQL statement that meets the following requirements:
- Outputs the item name of each item and returns a null value if the item name is longer than 20 characters
- Outputs the PurchaseDate value in the format of mm/dd, yy
How should you complete the statement? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.
NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

SELECT item_id AS ItemID,
_______ as ItemName
FROM Table1 
WHERE item_type = @itemtype_parameter

Answers:
convert( varchar(20), item_name)
convert( varchar(max), item_name)
try_cast( item_name as varchar(20)) (correct)
