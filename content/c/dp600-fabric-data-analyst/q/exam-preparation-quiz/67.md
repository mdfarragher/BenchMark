You have a Fabric warehouse that contains a table named Table1. Table1 contains the following data.

| Column name      | Data type   |
|-----------------|-------------|
| item_id         | Integer     |
| item_name       | varchar(50) |
| item_description| varchar(50) |
| purchase_date   | Datetime    |

You need to create a T-SQL statement that meets the following requirements:
- Outputs the item name of each item and returns a null value if the item name is longer than 20 characters
- Outputs the PurchaseDate value in the format of mm/dd, yy
How should you complete the statement? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.
NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

SELECT item_id AS ItemID,
_______ as PurchaseDate
FROM Table1 
WHERE item_type = @itemtype_parameter

Answers:
convert(varchar, purchase_date, 7) (correct)
convert(varchar, purchase_date, 109)
