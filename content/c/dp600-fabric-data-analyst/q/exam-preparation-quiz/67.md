You are working with a Microsoft Fabric warehouse at MDFT Academy that contains a table named Enrollments. The table contains the following columns:

| Column name      | Data type   |
|-----------------|-------------|
| course_id       | Integer     |
| course_name     | varchar(50) |
| enrollment_date | Datetime    |

You need to complete a T-SQL statement that meets these requirements:

- Output the course ID
- Output the enrollment_date in the format of 'Mon dd, yy' (for example: Apr 17, 25)

You have the following T-SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    course_id AS courseID,
    __________ AS EnrollmentDate
FROM Enrollments
```

How should you complete the query?
