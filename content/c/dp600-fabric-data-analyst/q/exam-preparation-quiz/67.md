    - id: "answer1"
      title: "convert(varchar, enrollment_date, 7)"
      correct: true
      explain: "Style 7 in the CONVERT function formats datetime values as 'Mon dd, yy' (e.g., 'Apr 17, 25'), which exactly matches the required output format. This is the standard format for short dates with abbreviated month names."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "convert(varchar, enrollment_date, 109)"
      explain: "Style 109 outputs the date in the format 'Mon dd yyyy hh:mi:ss:mmm(AM/PM)', which includes time components not required for this scenario."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "convert(varchar, enrollment_date, 112)"
      explain: "Style 112 outputs the date in ISO format 'yyyymmdd', which does not match the required format."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "convert(varchar, enrollment_date, 202)"
      explain: "Style 202 is not a valid style value."

You are working with a Microsoft Fabric warehouse at MDFT Pro that contains a table named **Enrollments**. The table contains the following columns:

| Column name      | Data type   |
|-----------------|-------------|
| course_id       | Integer     |
| course_name     | varchar(50) |
| enrollment_date | Datetime    |

You need to complete a T-SQL statement that meets these requirements:

- Output the course ID
- Output the enrollment_date in the format of 'Mon dd, yy' (for example: Apr 17, 25)

You have the following T-SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    course_id AS courseID,
    __________ AS EnrollmentDate
FROM Enrollments
```

How should you complete the query?
