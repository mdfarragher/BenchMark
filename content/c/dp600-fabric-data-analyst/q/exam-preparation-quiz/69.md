      title: "Fabric Admin"
      correct: true
      explain: "The Fabric Admin role has full administrative permissions over the entire Fabric tenant, including the ability to create new domains, create subdomains, and assign workspaces to domains. This is the only role that can create top-level domains. While it grants more permissions than strictly necessary, it is the minimum role that can perform all the required tasks in this scenario."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Workspace Admin"
      explain: "Workspace Admins can only manage workspace-level permissions and settings. This role cannot create or manage domains and subdomains, nor assign workspaces."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training provider, has a Fabric tenant that contains two workspaces named **WS1** and **WS2**. As the IT administrator, you need to ensure that your colleague Claire can perform the following tasks:

- Create a new domain named Training
- Create a new subdomain named Students
- Create a new subdomain named Instructors
- Assign WS1 to the Students subdomain
- Assign WS2 to the Instructors subdomain

The solution must follow the principle of least privilege. Which role should you assign to Claire?
