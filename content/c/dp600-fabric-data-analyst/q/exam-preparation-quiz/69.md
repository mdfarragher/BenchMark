MDFT Pro, a well-known training provider, has a Fabric tenant that contains two workspaces named WS1 and WS2. As the IT administrator, you need to ensure that your colleague Claire can perform the following tasks:

- Create a new domain named mdft.academy
- Create a new subdomain named students.mdft.academy
- Create a new subdomain named trainers.mdft.academy
- Assign WS1 to students.mdft.academy
- Assign WS2 to trainers.mdft.academy

The solution must follow the principle of least privilege. Which role should you assign to Claire?
