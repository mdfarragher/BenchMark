      explain: "Creating a role in the model is just the first step. For USERNAME() to return the correct user principal name, the user must access the model through an authenticated session where their identity is properly passed through. The user must also be assigned to the role, and in Entra Connect, SSO or Entra ID mapping must be configured to pass the identity correctly."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training organization. The academy's network contains an on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain that syncs with a Microsoft Entra tenant using Microsoft Entra Connect. 

MDFT Pro has a Fabric tenant containing a semantic model for student data. You enable dynamic row-level security (RLS) for the model and deploy it to the Fabric service. But when querying a measure that includes the USERNAME() function, it returns a blank result. 

To ensure that the measure returns the user principal name (UPN) of a user, you create a role in the model. 

Does this solve the problem?
