You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training organization. You have a Fabric tenant that contains a workspace named WS1 and a user named Mark. Mark does not have access to the tenant. 

WS1 contains a lakehouse named QUIZHOUSE, with the following permission settings:

```
Grant people access to: QUIZHOUSE
Shared with: Mark

Additional permissions:
[ ] Read all SQL endpoint data
[X] Read all Apache Spark
[ ] Build reports on the default semantic model
```

Based on these settings, what should Mark use to access the data in QUIZHOUSE?
