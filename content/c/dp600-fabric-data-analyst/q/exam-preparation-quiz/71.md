      title: "The default semantic model"
      explain: "The permissions shown explicitly do not grant permission to build reports on the default semantic model. This access method would not work for Mark."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "OneLake file and folder storage"
      correct: true
      explain: "The 'Read all Apache Spark' permission grants Mark access to the lakehouse data files and folders stored in OneLake. OneLake is the underlying storage layer for the lakehouse, and this permission allows users to access the data using Apache Spark-compatible APIs and tools without requiring SQL endpoint or semantic model permissions."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "The SQL Analytics Endpoint"
      explain: "The SQL Analytics Endpoint requires the 'Read all SQL endpoint data' permission, which is not granted to Mark. This endpoint provides T-SQL query access via the TDS protocol."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "DirectLake mode in Power BI"
      explain: "DirectLake mode requires the 'Build reports on the default semantic model' permission to create reports using DirectLake. While Mark has Apache Spark permissions to access the underlying OneLake data, they lack the required semantic model permissions to use DirectLake mode."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training organization. You have a Fabric tenant that contains a workspace named **WS1** and a user named Mark. Mark does not have access to the tenant. 

WS1 contains a lakehouse named **QUIZHOUSE**, with the following permission settings:

```text
Grant people access to: QUIZHOUSE
Shared with: Mark

Additional permissions:
[ ] Read all SQL endpoint data
[X] Read all Apache Spark
[ ] Build reports on the default semantic model
```

Based on these settings, what should Mark use to access the data in **QUIZHOUSE**?
