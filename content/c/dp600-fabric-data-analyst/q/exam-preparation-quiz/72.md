title: "Select How A User Can Access Lakehouse Data"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "A KQL queryset"
      explain: "KQL querysets are used for querying Kusto databases and logs in Azure. They cannot be used to query data in a Fabric lakehouse, even when Apache Spark permissions are granted."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "OneLake File Explorer"
      correct: true
      explain: "OneLake File Explorer is a Windows application that integrates with File Explorer and allows users to browse and query lakehouse data when they have 'Read all Apache Spark' permissions. It provides a familiar file-system interface to access OneLake data without requiring SQL endpoint access."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)"
      explain: "SSMS requires SQL endpoint access permissions, which are not granted in this scenario. The permissions show that 'Read all SQL endpoint data' is unchecked."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Azure Data Studio"
      explain: "Azure Data Studio, like SSMS, requires SQL endpoint access permissions to query lakehouse data. Since 'Read all SQL endpoint data' is not granted, this tool cannot be used."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training organization. You have a Fabric tenant that contains a workspace named **WS1** and a user named Mark. Mark does not have access to the tenant. 

**WS1** contains a lakehouse named **QUIZHOUSE**, with the following permission settings:

```text
Grant people access to: QUIZHOUSE
Shared with: Mark

Additional permissions:
[ ] Read all SQL endpoint data
[X] Read all Apache Spark
[ ] Build reports on the default semantic model
```

Based on these settings, what should Mark use to query the data in **QUIZHOUSE**?
