answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "A KQL queryset"
      explain: "KQL querysets are used for querying Kusto databases and logs in Azure. They cannot be used to query data in a Fabric lakehouse, even when Apache Spark permissions are granted."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "OneLake File Explorer"
      correct: true
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)"
      explain: "SSMS requires SQL endpoint access permissions, which are not granted in this scenario. The permissions show that 'Read all SQL endpoint data' is unchecked."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Azure Data Studio"
      explain: "Azure Data Studio, like SSMS, requires SQL endpoint access permissions to query lakehouse data. Since 'Read all SQL endpoint data' is not granted, this tool cannot be used."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "Azure Storage Explorer"
      explain: "Azure Storage Explorer is designed for managing Azure Storage accounts and their contents. It cannot directly access Fabric lakehouse data through Apache Spark permissions, as the lakehouse uses a different authentication and access model."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training organization. You have a Fabric tenant that contains a workspace named WS1 and a user named Mark. Mark does not have access to the tenant. 

WS1 contains a lakehouse named QUIZHOUSE, with the following permission settings:

```
Grant people access to: QUIZHOUSE
Shared with: Mark

Additional permissions:
[ ] Read all SQL endpoint data
[X] Read all Apache Spark
[ ] Build reports on the default semantic model
```

Based on these settings, what should Mark use to query the data in QUIZHOUSE?
