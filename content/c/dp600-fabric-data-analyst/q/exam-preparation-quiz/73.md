      title: "Open the lakehouse and select New semantic model from the ribbon"
      correct: true
      explain: "Since September 2025, default semantic models are no longer automatically created for lakehouses. To create a semantic model, you must open the lakehouse, select 'New semantic model' from the ribbon, provide a name, choose a workspace, and explicitly select which tables to include. This gives you full control over which tables are part of the semantic model."

      title: "Enable the 'Sync the default Power BI semantic model' option in lakehouse settings"
      explain: "This option is no longer available. Microsoft sunset default semantic models in September 2025. Semantic models are no longer automatically created or synced with lakehouses."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Configure the SQL analytics endpoint to auto-generate the semantic model"
      explain: "The SQL analytics endpoint automatically generates tables for querying Delta tables, but it does not create semantic models. Since September 2025, semantic models must be manually created."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Wait for the lakehouse to automatically create the semantic model after adding tables"
      explain: "This no longer happens. Since September 2025, Fabric no longer automatically creates default semantic models for lakehouses. You must manually create semantic models when needed."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency. You have a Fabric tenant that contains a lakehouse named **QUIZHOUSE** with several tables containing student enrollment and assessment data.

You need to create a Power BI semantic model that includes specific tables from **QUIZHOUSE** so that report creators can build reports.

What should you do?
