You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training organization. The academy has a Fabric workspace named WS1 that is used to store and analyze student performance data.

WS1 contains multiple semantic models, including a model named StudentModel that tracks student progress. StudentModel is updated regularly using an XMLA endpoint to incorporate new training results.

You need to increase the speed of the write operations of the XMLA endpoint to ensure faster updates of student data.

What should you do?
