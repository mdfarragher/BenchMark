      title: "Schedule a data pipeline that calls other data pipelines"
      correct: true
      explain: "A data pipeline that calls other pipelines using the Invoke Pipeline activity is the best approach for orchestrating medallion layer population. This allows you to create a master pipeline that coordinates the execution of separate pipelines for bronze, silver, and gold layers in the correct sequence, with proper dependency management and error handling."

      title: "Schedule a notebook"
      correct: false
      explain: "A notebook can process data for medallion layers, but it doesn't provide the orchestration capabilities needed to manage multiple layer transformations. Notebooks are better suited for individual data transformations rather than coordinating complex multi-layer workflows."

      title: "Schedule an Apache Spark job"
      correct: false
      explain: "An Apache Spark job can execute data transformations but lacks built-in orchestration features for managing dependencies between layers. It would require additional custom code to handle the sequential processing of bronze, silver, and gold layers."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Schedule multiple data pipelines"
      correct: false
      explain: "Scheduling multiple independent pipelines doesn't provide coordination between the layers. Each pipeline would run on its own schedule without awareness of dependencies, potentially causing data consistency issues if a downstream layer starts before its upstream layer completes."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that provides certification preparation courses. Mark, a Data Engineer at MDFT Pro, is implementing a medallion architecture in Microsoft Fabric to organize the company's student enrollment and course completion data. The architecture uses three layers: bronze (raw data from various sources), silver (cleansed and validated data), and gold (aggregated data for reporting). Each layer requires different transformations and must be populated in sequence to ensure data quality. The bronze layer ingests raw data, the silver layer cleanses and standardizes it, and the gold layer creates aggregated views for business intelligence reports.

What should Mark use to schedule the population of the medallion layers?
