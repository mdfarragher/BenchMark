title: "Choose Tools for Dataset Processing"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "A T-SQL statement"
      correct: true
      explain: "T-SQL is the best choice for Dataset1 because it provides built-in IDENTITY column support for auto-incrementing integer primary keys starting from 1 with an increment of 1. This minimizes development effort by using native database functionality without requiring custom code."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "A Dataflow Gen2 dataflow"
      correct: false
      explain: "Dataflow Gen2 is designed for data transformation using Power Query and doesn't natively support automatic generation of sequential integer primary keys. Implementing this functionality would require additional custom logic and increase development effort."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "A Notebook"
      correct: false
      explain: "While notebooks can generate sequential primary keys using PySpark or SQL, this requires writing custom code. T-SQL provides built-in IDENTITY column functionality that requires less development effort."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "A KQL Queryset"
      correct: false
      explain: "KQL (Kusto Query Language) is designed for real-time analytics on streaming data in eventhouses, not for managing structured tables with primary key constraints. It doesn't provide the necessary functionality for creating auto-incrementing primary keys."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that offers certification preparation courses worldwide. Claire, a Database Administrator at MDFT Pro, is planning to process three different datasets in Microsoft Fabric. The first dataset (Dataset1) contains student enrollment records that need to be loaded into a Fabric warehouse. Each enrollment record must have a unique identifier that automatically increments, starting from 1 and incrementing by 1 for each new record. This primary key will be used to link enrollments to other tables in the data warehouse. Claire wants to use built-in Fabric functionality to automatically generate these sequential identifiers without writing custom code, minimizing development effort and ensuring data integrity. The solution should leverage native database features for generating unique, sequential primary keys during the data loading process.

The datasets have the following characteristics:
- **Dataset1**: Requires a unique auto-incrementing integer primary key (starting at 1, incrementing by 1)
- **Dataset2**: Contains semi-structured data with custom visuals needed for development
- **Dataset3**: Located in a lakehouse, requires row-based windowing functions during bulk loading

What should Claire use to process Dataset1?
