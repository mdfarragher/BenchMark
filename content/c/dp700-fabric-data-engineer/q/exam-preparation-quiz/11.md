title: "Process Semi-Structured Data with Visualizations"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "A T-SQL statement"
      correct: false
      explain: "T-SQL is designed for structured, relational data in warehouses and doesn't provide native support for semi-structured data formats like JSON or nested structures. It also lacks the interactive visualization capabilities needed for development mode exploration."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "A Dataflow Gen2 dataflow"
      correct: false
      explain: "While Dataflow Gen2 can handle semi-structured data, it provides limited visualization options compared to notebooks. The Power Query interface doesn't offer the custom visualizations and interactive exploration capabilities required for development mode analysis of complex semi-structured data."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "A Notebook"
      correct: true
      explain: "Notebooks are ideal for Dataset2 because they support semi-structured data formats (JSON, Parquet, XML) using PySpark, provide interactive custom visualizations with libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, and handle bulk data transfers efficiently. The notebook's interactive development environment allows you to explore and visualize data in real-time during the transformation process."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "A KQL Queryset"
      correct: false
      explain: "KQL querysets are designed for real-time analytics on streaming data in eventhouses, not for bulk data transfer and transformation scenarios. While KQL can handle semi-structured data, it doesn't provide the comprehensive visualization and development capabilities that notebooks offer."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that offers certification preparation courses worldwide. Mark, a Data Scientist at MDFT Pro, is planning to process three different datasets in Microsoft Fabric. The second dataset (Dataset2) contains semi-structured student interaction logs from the company's learning platform, including nested JSON data with user session information, navigation patterns, and engagement metrics. This data needs to be bulk transferred from an Azure Data Lake Storage account to a Fabric lakehouse in a single operation. During the development phase, Mark needs to explore the data structure using custom visualizations to understand patterns and anomalies, create charts to visualize user behavior, and iteratively refine the transformation logic while viewing the results in real-time. The solution should provide an interactive development environment that supports both code execution and rich data visualization.

The datasets have the following characteristics:
- **Dataset1**: Requires a unique auto-incrementing integer primary key (starting at 1, incrementing by 1)
- **Dataset2**: Semi-structured data requiring bulk transfer with custom visualizations for development
- **Dataset3**: Located in a lakehouse, requires row-based windowing functions during bulk loading

What should Mark use to process Dataset2?
