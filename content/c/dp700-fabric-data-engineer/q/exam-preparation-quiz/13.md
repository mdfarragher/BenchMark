title: "Implement Column-Level Security"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "GRANT"
      correct: true
      explain: "The GRANT T-SQL statement is used to implement column-level security in Fabric warehouses. You can specify which columns a user or role can access by using syntax like GRANT SELECT ON schema.table (Column1, Column2) TO [user@domain.com]. This allows you to control access at a granular column level."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "CONSTRAINT"
      correct: false
      explain: "CONSTRAINT is used to define rules for data integrity (like primary keys, foreign keys, check constraints) but is not used for implementing security policies. Column-level security requires permissions management, not data constraints."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "SCHEMA"
      correct: false
      explain: "SCHEMA is a database object that contains tables, views, and other objects, but it's not a command for implementing security. While schemas help organize objects, column-level security is implemented using permission statements like GRANT."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "FUNCTION"
      correct: false
      explain: "Functions are used to implement row-level security (RLS) by creating predicates that filter rows, but column-level security requires a different approach using GRANT statements to control access to specific columns."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that offers certification preparation courses. Mark, a Database Security Administrator at MDFT Pro, manages a Fabric warehouse called CourseData that contains sensitive student information. The warehouse has a table called Students with columns including StudentID, Name, Email, EnrollmentDate, PaymentAmount, and CreditCardNumber. Multiple trainers and administrative staff need access to student records, but for privacy and compliance reasons, they should only see columns relevant to their role. For example, trainers should see student names and enrollment dates but not payment information or credit card numbers. Mark needs to implement column-level security to restrict which columns different users can access while still allowing them to query the Students table.

Which T-SQL command should Mark use to implement column-level security in the warehouse?
