You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that offers certification preparation courses. Mark, a Data Engineering Team Lead at MDFT Pro, manages a Fabric workspace containing a warehouse called StudentData. The warehouse is populated with student enrollment and course completion data using a notebook called LoadStudentData. Recently, Mark's team upgraded their Fabric environment to use a newer runtime version that includes Delta Lake 4.0 support. However, some data quality issues have emerged, and Mark suspects they might be related to Delta version incompatibilities between different notebook runs. He needs to investigate which specific version of Delta Lake was used during previous executions of the LoadStudentData notebook to determine if older runs used a different version that might explain the data discrepancies. This information will help him track down whether the issues started when they switched Delta versions.

What should Mark use to identify which version of Delta was used when the LoadStudentData notebook was executed?
