      title: "User 3 has Viewer role access to Workspace 3"
      correct: true
      explain: "User3 has Viewer role access to Workspace3 because User3 is a member of Group1, which was added to the default domain list of Domain1. When User1 creates Workspace3, it's automatically assigned to Domain1 (since User1 is also in Group1). Members of the default domain's security group receive Viewer role access to workspaces in that domain."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "User 3 has Domain Contributor access to Domain 1"
      correct: false
      explain: "User3 does not have Domain Contributor access to Domain1. Being in the default domain security group only provides Viewer access to workspaces within that domain, not domain-level contributor permissions. Only Domain Admins have domain management permissions."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "User 2 has Contributor role access to Workspace 3"
      correct: false
      explain: "User2 does not have any access to Workspace3. User2 is not in Group1, is not the Domain Admin of Domain1 (where Workspace3 is assigned), and was not explicitly granted access to Workspace3."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "User 1 has Viewer role access to Workspace 2"
      correct: false
      explain: "User1 does not have access to Workspace2. User1 is not the Workspace Admin of Workspace2 (User2 is), and being a Domain Admin of Domain1 doesn't automatically grant access to workspaces in other domains or unassigned workspaces owned by other users."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that has implemented Microsoft Fabric domains to organize workspaces by department. The company has three users: Mark (Course Development Manager), Claire (Student Services Director), and Alex (Data Analyst). Initially, there are two workspaces: CourseContent (administered by Mark) and StudentRecords (administered by Claire). The Fabric admin creates two domains: Training (with Mark as Domain Admin) and Services (with Claire as Domain Admin). To organize data governance, a security group called TRAINERS is created containing Mark and Alex. The Fabric admin adds the TRAINERS group to the default domain list for the Training domain. Mark then creates a new workspace called AssessmentData to store quiz and exam results.

Based on this configuration, which of the following statements about permissions are correct?
