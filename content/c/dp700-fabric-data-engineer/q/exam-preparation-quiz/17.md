      title: "Stores only"
      correct: false
      explain: "While Stores was accessed 4 hours ago and will be retrieved from cache, Products was also accessed within the cache retention period (12 hours ago) and will also be retrieved from cache."

      title: "Products only"
      correct: false
      explain: "While Products was accessed 12 hours ago and will be retrieved from cache, Stores was also accessed more recently (4 hours ago) and will also be retrieved from cache."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Stores and Products only"
      correct: true
      explain: "Both Stores (accessed 4 hours ago) and Products (accessed 12 hours ago) were accessed within the default 24-hour cache retention period, so their data will be retrieved from cache. Trips was accessed 48 hours ago, which exceeds the retention period, so it will be retrieved from the source."

      title: "Products, Stores, and Trips"
      correct: false
      explain: "Trips was last accessed 48 hours ago, which exceeds the default 24-hour cache retention period. Files that haven't been accessed within the retention period are purged from the cache and must be retrieved from the source."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "Trips only"
      correct: false
      explain: "Trips was accessed 48 hours ago, which exceeds the cache retention period, so it will not be retrieved from cache but from the source. Products and Stores, which were accessed more recently, will be retrieved from cache."
    - id: "answer6"
      title: "Products and Trips only"
      correct: false
      explain: "Trips was accessed 48 hours ago, which exceeds the cache retention period and will not be cached. Stores was accessed 4 hours ago and will also be retrieved from cache along with Products."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency with operations across multiple cloud platforms. Claire, a Data Integration Specialist at MDFT Pro, manages data from Google Cloud Storage that contains course materials, student records, and attendance tracking data. The company has enabled OneLake shortcut caching in their Fabric workspace to reduce data egress costs and improve query performance when accessing this cross-cloud data. In the CourseMaterials lakehouse, Claire has created three shortcuts pointing to files in Google Cloud Storage: Products (8 MB Parquet file, last accessed 12 hours ago), Stores (500 MB JSON file, last accessed 4 hours ago), and Trips (99 MB CSV file, last accessed 48 hours ago). The workspace is configured with the default cache retention period of 24 hours. Claire needs to run a query that reads data from all three shortcuts and wants to understand which ones will benefit from cached data access versus requiring retrieval from Google Cloud Storage.

Which shortcuts will retrieve data from the cache when Claire runs her query?
