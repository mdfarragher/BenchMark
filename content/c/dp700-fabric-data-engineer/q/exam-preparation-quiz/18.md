title: "Configure ForEach Activity Items"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "output"
      correct: false
      explain: "Using just 'output' returns the entire output object from the Lookup activity, which includes metadata like count and value array. The ForEach activity requires specifically the array of items to iterate over, not the entire output object."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "output.value"
      correct: true
      explain: "The correct expression is 'output.value' which accesses the value array property from the Lookup activity's output. This array contains the rows returned by the lookup query, and the ForEach activity will iterate over each row in this array."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "output.count"
      correct: false
      explain: "The 'output.count' property returns the number of rows returned by the Lookup activity as an integer. The ForEach activity needs an array of items to iterate over, not a count value."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "output.pipelineReturnValue"
      correct: false
      explain: "The 'output.pipelineReturnValue' property is used to access values explicitly returned by child pipelines when using the Invoke Pipeline activity. Lookup activities don't use this property; they return data in the 'value' array."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that manages student data across multiple databases. Mark, a Data Engineer at MDFT Pro, is building a dynamic data orchestration pipeline called StudentDataSync. The pipeline needs to copy data from 25 different tables in an Azure SQL database into a Fabric lakehouse. To make the pipeline maintainable, Mark uses a metadata-driven approach with a control table that lists all the schemas and table names to be copied. The pipeline has two activities: a Lookup activity named "Lookup Schema and Table" that queries the control table and returns a list of schemas and tables, followed by a ForEach activity named "Extraction Loop" that iterates over each table and copies it. Mark is now configuring the ForEach activity and needs to specify which items the loop should iterate over. The pipeline expression for accessing the Lookup activity's output begins with `@activity('Lookup Schema and Table').` and Mark needs to complete it to reference the array of table rows returned by the lookup.

How should Mark complete the expression to properly configure the items property of the ForEach activity?
