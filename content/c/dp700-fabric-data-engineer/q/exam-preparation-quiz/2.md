title: "Prepare Data for a Star Schema Dimension Table"
type: "question"
layout: "multiple"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Date"
      correct: false
      explain: "The Date column is a transactional attribute that belongs in the fact table (FactSales), not the dimension table. Fact tables store measurements and events with their associated timestamps, while dimension tables contain descriptive attributes about entities."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "MaterialName"
      correct: true
      explain: "MaterialName is a descriptive attribute that characterizes materials and belongs in the DimMaterial dimension table. Dimension tables store descriptive information about business entities that can be used for grouping and filtering in reports."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "MaterialType"
      correct: true
      explain: "MaterialType is a descriptive attribute of materials and should be included in the DimMaterial dimension table. This allows analysts to filter and group sales data by material type in their reports."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "TransactionID"
      correct: false
      explain: "TransactionID is a transactional identifier that belongs in the fact table (FactSales). It identifies specific sales transactions and is not a descriptive attribute of materials."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "SalesAmount"
      correct: false
      explain: "SalesAmount is a numeric measure that belongs in the fact table (FactSales). Fact tables store measurements and metrics that can be aggregated, while dimension tables contain descriptive attributes."
    - id: "answer6"
      title: "MaterialID"
      correct: true
      explain: "MaterialID is the unique identifier for materials and must be included in the DimMaterial dimension table as the primary key. This key is used to link the dimension table to the fact table in the star schema."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that offers professional certification courses. Mark, a Business Intelligence Analyst at MDFT Pro, has been asked to design a data warehouse to analyze course material sales. 

Currently, all sales data is stored in a flat table in a Fabric lakehouse called **CourseMaterials**. The table contains the following columns:

| Column Name   | Description                                          |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| TransactionID | The unique transaction ID |
| Date          | The date of the transaction                   |
| MaterialID     | The unique ID of the purchased course material                |
| MaterialColor  | The type of the course material                   |
| MaterialName   | The name of the course material              |
| SalesAmount   | The sales amount of the transaction           |

Mark plans to implement a star schema by creating two tables: **FactSales** (for transaction metrics) and **DimMaterial** (for material information). The **DimMaterial** table will track changes over time using slowly changing dimension techniques.

Which three columns should Mark include in the **DimMaterial** table?
