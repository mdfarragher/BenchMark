layout: "multiple"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Date"
      correct: false
      explain: "The Date column is a transactional attribute that belongs in the fact table (FactSales), not the dimension table. Fact tables store measurements and events with their associated timestamps, while dimension tables contain descriptive attributes about entities."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "ProductName"
      correct: true
      explain: "ProductName is a descriptive attribute that characterizes products and belongs in the DimProduct dimension table. Dimension tables store descriptive information about business entities that can be used for grouping and filtering in reports."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "ProductColor"
      correct: true
      explain: "ProductColor is a descriptive attribute of products and should be included in the DimProduct dimension table. This allows analysts to filter and group sales data by product color in their reports."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "TransactionID"
      correct: false
      explain: "TransactionID is a transactional identifier that belongs in the fact table (FactSales). It identifies specific sales transactions and is not a descriptive attribute of products."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "SalesAmount"
      correct: false
      explain: "SalesAmount is a numeric measure that belongs in the fact table (FactSales). Fact tables store measurements and metrics that can be aggregated, while dimension tables contain descriptive attributes."
    - id: "answer6"
      title: "ProductID"
      correct: true
      explain: "ProductID is the unique identifier for products and must be included in the DimProduct dimension table as the primary key. This key is used to link the dimension table to the fact table in the star schema."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that offers professional certification courses. Claire, a Business Intelligence Analyst at MDFT Pro, has been asked to design a data warehouse to analyze course material sales. Currently, all sales data is stored in a flat table in a Fabric lakehouse called CourseMaterials. The table contains the following columns:

| Column Name   | Description                                          |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| TransactionID | Contains a unique ID for each transaction            |
| Date          | Contains the date of a transaction                   |
| ProductID     | Contains a unique ID for each product                |
| ProductColor  | Contains the color of each product                   |
| ProductName   | Contains a unique name for each product              |
| SalesAmount   | Contains the sales amount of a transaction           |
| Description   | Contains a descriptive attribute of the product      |

Claire plans to implement a star schema by creating two tables: FactSales (for transaction metrics) and DimProduct (for product information). The DimProduct table will track changes over time using slowly changing dimension techniques.

Which three columns should Claire include in the DimProduct table?
