      title: "Yes, this solution meets the goal"
      correct: false
      explain: "While Fabric eventstreams support SQL transformations through the SQL operator feature (introduced in 2025), SQL is not the optimal language for querying KQL database tables. KQL is the native query language for KQL databases and provides better performance, more features, and is the recommended approach for this scenario."

      title: "No, this solution does not meet the goal"
      correct: true
      explain: "The solution does not meet the goal because KQL (Kusto Query Language) should be used to query data in KQL databases, not SQL. While eventstreams support SQL for transformations, the data being queried resides in a KQL database table, which is optimized for KQL queries. The correct approach would use KQL syntax with operators like filter, sort, and project."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that operates a bike-sharing program for students and staff across multiple campus locations. Mark, a Data Engineer at MDFT Pro, has been asked to create a real-time monitoring system for bike availability. The company uses a Fabric eventstream to capture bike location data and load it into a table called Bike_Location in a KQL database. The table tracks bike stations across different campus neighborhoods, recording the number of available bikes and empty docking spaces at each location. Mark needs to create a query that filters and transforms this streaming data to show bike stations in the Sands End campus area where there are at least 15 bikes available, with results ordered by the number of bikes. He plans to use the following SQL code to accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT BikepointID, Street, Neighbourhood, No_Bikes, No_Empty_Docks, Timestamp
FROM bike_location
WHERE neighbourhood = 'Sands End'
AND no_bikes >= 15
ORDER BY no_bikes
```

Does this SQL-based solution meet the goal of querying and transforming the data in the KQL database?
