title: "Specify Pipeline Parameter Expression Syntax"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "@pipeline().parameters.param1"
      correct: false
      explain: "This syntax is missing the curly braces required for string interpolation. While this might work in some contexts where a pure expression is expected, it doesn't ensure the parameter value is properly evaluated and converted to its specified data type (int) in all situations."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "@{pipeline().parameters.param1}"
      correct: true
      explain: "This is the correct syntax for accessing pipeline parameters in expressions. The @{ ... } wrapper ensures proper string interpolation and expression evaluation, allowing the parameter value to be correctly returned as its declared data type (int). This syntax works consistently across all activity properties and dynamic content scenarios."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "@{pipeline().parameters.[param1]}"
      correct: false
      explain: "This syntax uses bracket notation, which is only necessary when referencing nested subfields or when parameter names contain special characters. For simple parameter names like 'param1', dot notation is the standard and preferred approach."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "@pipeline().parameters.[param1]"
      correct: false
      explain: "This syntax combines missing curly braces with unnecessary bracket notation. It lacks the @{ ... } wrapper needed for proper expression evaluation and uses brackets when simple dot notation would suffice for a standard parameter name."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that processes student enrollment data from multiple sources. Mark, a Data Engineer at MDFT Pro, is building a data pipeline called EnrollmentIngestion that loads student records into a lakehouse named StudentData. The pipeline needs to be flexible and reusable across different departments, each of which stores data in separate database schemas. To achieve this, Mark creates a pipeline parameter called param1 with a data type of int that will receive a department ID value from an external system. This department ID will be used to filter which records get loaded during each pipeline execution. Mark needs to reference this parameter in various pipeline activities, ensuring the value is properly evaluated and returned as an integer throughout the pipeline's execution.

How should Mark specify the pipeline expression to access the param1 parameter value as an int?
