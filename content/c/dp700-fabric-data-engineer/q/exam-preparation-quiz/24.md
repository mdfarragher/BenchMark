title: "Deploy Workspace with Folder Structure Changes"

      title: "Folder1 is created, Pipeline1 moves to Folder1, and Lakehouse1 is deployed"
      correct: true
      explain: "This is correct because deployment pipelines preserve folder structure changes. When Pipeline1 is moved to Folder1 in Workspace1 and then deployed, the deployment process creates Folder1 in Workspace2 (if it doesn't exist), moves Pipeline1 to that folder, and also deploys Lakehouse1 which was already part of the workspace. All workspace items and their folder locations are synchronized during deployment."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Only Pipeline1 and Lakehouse1 are deployed"
      correct: false
      explain: "This is incorrect because it ignores the folder structure change. Deployment pipelines don't just deploy items; they also replicate the folder hierarchy from the source workspace. Folder1 would be created in Workspace2 as part of the deployment process."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Folder1 is created, and Pipeline1 and Lakehouse1 move to Folder1"
      correct: false
      explain: "This is incorrect because Lakehouse1 was not moved to Folder1 in Workspace1. Only Pipeline1 was moved to Folder1. Deployment pipelines replicate the exact folder structure from the source workspace, so Lakehouse1 would remain in its original location (the workspace root) in Workspace2."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Only Folder1 is created and Pipeline1 moves to Folder1"
      correct: false
      explain: "This is incorrect because deployment pipelines synchronize all workspace items, not just those that changed. Even though only Pipeline1's location changed, Lakehouse1 would also be deployed to ensure Workspace2 remains synchronized with Workspace1."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that uses Microsoft Fabric deployment pipelines to manage their development and production environments. Claire, a DevOps Engineer at MDFT Pro, manages two workspaces: DevWorkspace (for development) and ProdWorkspace (for production). The DevWorkspace currently contains a data pipeline called StudentDataPipeline that loads enrollment data, and a lakehouse called EnrollmentData that stores the processed information. Both items are in the workspace root. To improve organization, Claire creates a new folder called DataIngestion in DevWorkspace and moves StudentDataPipeline into it, while EnrollmentData remains in the root. She has configured a deployment pipeline called PromoteToProd that deploys DevWorkspace to ProdWorkspace. After restructuring DevWorkspace with the new folder, Claire runs the deployment pipeline to synchronize the changes to ProdWorkspace.

What occurs to ProdWorkspace after the deployment?
