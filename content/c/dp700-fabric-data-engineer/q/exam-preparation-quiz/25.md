      title: "Workspace Admin"
      correct: false
      explain: "Workspace Admin role only provides permissions within a specific workspace, not at the domain level. While workspace admins can request that their workspace be assigned to a domain, they cannot create domains or subdomains, which are required tasks in this scenario."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Domain admin"
      correct: true
      explain: "Domain admin is the correct role following the principle of least privilege. Domain admins can create subdomains within their parent domain, assign workspaces to domains and subdomains, and manage domain settings. This role provides exactly the permissions needed for the required tasks without granting unnecessary tenant-wide privileges."

      title: "Domain contributor"
      correct: false
      explain: "Domain contributor is not a standard role in Microsoft Fabric's domain structure. The available domain roles are domain admin (who can manage the domain and its subdomains) and Fabric admin (who can create and manage all domains). Domain contributor doesn't exist as a distinct role with the necessary permissions."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Fabric admin"
      correct: false
      explain: "While Fabric admin can perform all the required tasks, this role violates the principle of least privilege. Fabric admins have tenant-wide administrative privileges across all domains and workspaces, which is far more access than needed for managing a single domain and its subdomains."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency with operations across multiple geographic regions. The company has decided to implement a domain strategy to organize their Fabric workspaces according to their organizational structure. Mark, a Business Unit Manager at MDFT Pro, needs to set up a domain structure for the sales department. The company currently has two workspaces: EastSales (containing sales data and reports for the eastern region) and WestSales (containing sales data and reports for the western region). Mark needs to create a new parent domain called "Sales," then create two subdomains within it: "East Region" for eastern sales operations and "West Region" for western sales operations. After creating these subdomains, he must assign the EastSales workspace to the East Region subdomain and the WestSales workspace to the West Region subdomain. The company's security policy requires following the principle of least privilege when assigning permissions.

Which role should be assigned to Mark to perform these domain management tasks?
