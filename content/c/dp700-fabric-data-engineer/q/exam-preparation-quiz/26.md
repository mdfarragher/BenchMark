      title: "Trips and Stores only"
      correct: false
      explain: "The Trips shortcut points to a 2 GB file, which exceeds the 1 GB file size limit for caching. Files larger than 1 GB are not cached in OneLake shortcuts, so Trips data will always be retrieved from the source (Amazon S3) rather than cache."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Products and Stores only"
      correct: true
      explain: "Both Products (50 MB in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2) and Stores (25 MB in Amazon S3) are under the 1 GB file size limit and will be cached. While ADLS Gen2 integrates natively with OneLake and doesn't technically use the cache feature the same way S3 does, both shortcuts will provide data without requiring retrieval from external sources."

      title: "Stores only"
      correct: false
      explain: "While Stores (25 MB) will be cached, Products (50 MB) is also under the 1 GB limit and will also benefit from OneLake's integration. Both shortcuts will provide efficient data access without requiring external retrieval."

      title: "Products only"
      correct: false
      explain: "While Products (50 MB) will benefit from OneLake's native ADLS Gen2 integration, Stores (25 MB) from Amazon S3 will also be cached since it's under the 1 GB limit. Both shortcuts provide efficient data access."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "Products, Stores, and Trips"
      correct: false
      explain: "The Trips shortcut cannot be cached because it points to a 2 GB file, which exceeds the 1 GB file size limit for OneLake shortcut caching. Only files under 1 GB can be cached."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency with data stored across multiple cloud platforms. Claire, a Data Platform Engineer at MDFT Pro, manages a Fabric lakehouse called TrainingData that consolidates data from various sources using OneLake shortcuts. The company has enabled shortcut caching in their workspace to optimize performance and reduce cross-cloud egress costs. The lakehouse contains three shortcuts: Products (pointing to a 50 MB Delta Parquet file in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 containing the course catalog), Stores (pointing to a 25 MB Delta Parquet file in Amazon S3 with campus location data), and Trips (pointing to a 2 GB Delta Parquet file in Amazon S3 containing one month of student commute data for transportation planning). Claire needs to understand which shortcuts will benefit from cached data access to optimize query performance and minimize cloud egress charges when analysts query this data.

Which shortcuts will retrieve data from the cache when queries are executed against the lakehouse?
