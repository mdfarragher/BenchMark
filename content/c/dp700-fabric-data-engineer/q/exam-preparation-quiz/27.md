title: "Configure Git Integration with Azure DevOps"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "The personal access token (PAT) for Git authentication and the Git repository URL"
      correct: false
      explain: "While PATs were required in earlier versions of Git integration, modern Fabric Git integration uses Azure Active Directory authentication rather than personal access tokens. The configuration doesn't require manually entering a repository URL; instead, you select from available repositories using organization and project information."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "The Git repository URL and the Git folder"
      correct: false
      explain: "Fabric's Git integration doesn't use direct repository URLs for Azure DevOps. Instead, it uses a structured selection process where you choose the organization, project, repository, and branch from dropdowns. The Git folder is optional and can be left blank to use the root folder."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "The project, Git repository, branch, and Git folder"
      correct: false
      explain: "While these fields are part of the configuration, this answer is incomplete. You must also specify the Azure DevOps organization before you can select a project. The organization is a required top-level container in the Azure DevOps hierarchy."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "The organization, project, Git repository, and branch"
      correct: true
      explain: "These are the required details for configuring Git integration with Azure DevOps. You must specify the organization (your Azure DevOps account), project (containing the repository), Git repository (where items will be synchronized), and branch (the specific branch to connect). The Git folder is optional and defaults to the root folder if not specified."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that uses Azure DevOps for source control and version management. Mark, a Workspace Administrator at MDFT Pro, manages a Fabric workspace called DataEngineering that contains data pipelines, notebooks, and semantic models for the company's analytics platform. To enable proper version control, collaboration, and deployment practices, Mark needs to connect the DataEngineering workspace to an Azure DevOps Git repository. The Azure DevOps administrator has already created the necessary infrastructure: an Azure DevOps organization called "mdftpro," a project called "FabricDevelopment," and a Git repository called "analytics-workspace" with an initialized main branch. Mark now needs to configure the Git integration in his Fabric workspace to synchronize workspace items with this repository. He needs to know which specific details from Azure DevOps are required to complete the Git integration configuration.

Which details does Mark require to configure Git integration for the workspace?
