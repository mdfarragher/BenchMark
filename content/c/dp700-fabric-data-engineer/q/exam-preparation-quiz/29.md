title: "Configure Pipeline with Notebook and Model Refresh"
type: "question"
layout: "multiple"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "From the Schedule settings of Notebook1, set the time zone to UTC"
      correct: false
      explain: "Notebooks don't have their own schedule settings when executed as part of a pipeline. The scheduling is controlled at the pipeline level, not at the individual activity level. Setting a time zone in the notebook would have no effect on when the pipeline runs."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Set the Retry setting of the Semantic model refresh activity to 2"
      correct: false
      explain: "The retry requirement applies to the notebook execution, not the semantic model refresh. The model should only refresh after the notebook succeeds, so if the refresh fails, the issue is likely with the model itself rather than temporary failures that would benefit from retries."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Place the Semantic model refresh activity after the Notebook activity and link the activities by using an On completion condition"
      correct: false
      explain: "On completion would execute the refresh whether the notebook succeeds or fails. Since the model refresh should only occur after successful data ingestion and transformation, using On completion could result in refreshing the model with incomplete or incorrect data."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "From the Schedule settings of Pipeline1, set the time zone to UTC"
      correct: true
      explain: "Pipeline scheduling is configured at the pipeline level. To ensure the pipeline runs at 07:00 AM UTC, you must set the time zone to UTC in the pipeline's schedule settings. This ensures consistent execution time regardless of the Fabric capacity's geographic location."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "Place the Semantic model refresh activity after the Notebook activity and link the activities by using the On success condition"
      correct: true
      explain: "Using the On success condition ensures the semantic model refresh only executes if the notebook completes successfully. This prevents refreshing the model with potentially incomplete or incorrect data, maintaining data quality and consistency."
    - id: "answer6"
      title: "Set the Retry setting of the Notebook activity to 2"
      correct: true
      explain: "Setting the retry count to 2 on the Notebook activity meets the requirement to retry twice if the notebook fails. This helps handle transient failures like temporary network issues or resource contention without requiring manual intervention."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that processes student enrollment data daily. Mark, a Data Engineer at MDFT Pro, manages a data pipeline called DailyEnrollmentProcessor that runs a notebook to ingest and transform enrollment data from an external student information system, then updates a semantic model used by business intelligence reports. The notebook (EnrollmentTransform) loads new enrollment records, validates data quality, and writes the processed data to a lakehouse. After the data is successfully loaded, the semantic model (EnrollmentMetrics) must be refreshed so that management dashboards reflect the latest enrollment figures. The pipeline must run automatically every morning at 07:00 AM UTC to process overnight enrollments. Occasionally, the external system experiences temporary connection issues, so the notebook should retry up to twice before failing. The semantic model should only refresh if the notebook completes successfully to avoid showing incomplete data in reports.

Which three actions should Mark perform to configure Pipeline1? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.
