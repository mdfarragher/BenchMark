    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Yes, this solution meets the goal"
      correct: true
      explain: "The KQL query correctly uses the filter operator to select records where Neighbourhood is 'Sands End' and No_Bikes is at least 15, the sort operator to order results by No_Bikes in ascending order, and the project operator to select the required columns. This meets all the stated requirements."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "No, this solution does not meet the goal"
      correct: false
      explain: "The query actually does meet the goal. It properly filters the data for the Sands End neighbourhood with at least 15 bikes, sorts the results in ascending order by No_Bikes, and projects all the required columns."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that operates a bike-sharing program for students and staff across multiple campus locations. Mark, a Data Analyst at MDFT Pro, has been asked to create a real-time monitoring dashboard for bike availability. The company uses a Fabric eventstream to capture bike location data and load it into a table called Bike_Location in a KQL database. The table contains the following columns:

| Column Name     | Description                                    |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| BikepointID     | Unique identifier for each bike station        |
| Street          | Street address of the bike station             |
| Neighbourhood   | Campus area where the bike station is located  |
| No_Bikes        | Current number of available bikes              |
| No_Empty_Docks  | Current number of empty docking spaces         |
| Timestamp       | Time when the data was captured                |

Mark needs to create a query that shows bike stations in the Sands End campus area where there are at least 15 bikes available, ordered by the number of bikes in ascending order. He plans to use the following KQL code:

```kql
bike_location
| filter Neighbourhood == "Sands End" and No_Bikes >= 15
| sort by No_Bikes asc
| project BikepointID, Street, Neighbourhood, No_Bikes, No_Empty_Docks, Timestamp
```

Does this solution meet the goal?
