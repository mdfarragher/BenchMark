title: "Apply Dynamic Data Masking to Sensitive Data"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "DEFAULT"
      correct: false
      explain: "The DEFAULT masking function completely masks the data based on the data type (XXXX for strings, 0 for numbers). It doesn't allow partial visibility of specific characters at the beginning and end of the value, which is needed for this scenario."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "MASK"
      correct: false
      explain: "MASK is not a valid dynamic data masking function name in Microsoft Fabric. The available functions are DEFAULT, EMAIL, RANDOM, and PARTIAL."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "EMAIL"
      correct: false
      explain: "The EMAIL function is designed specifically for masking email addresses by exposing only the first letter and the domain suffix. It's not appropriate for credit card numbers where you need custom control over which characters to show."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "PARTIAL"
      correct: true
      explain: "The PARTIAL function allows you to specify exactly how many characters to show from the beginning (prefix), what padding to use in the middle, and how many characters to show at the end (suffix). The syntax PARTIAL(2, 'XXXXXXXXXX', 4) shows the first 2 characters, masks the middle with X's, and shows the last 4 characters of the credit card."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "DDM"
      correct: false
      explain: "DDM (Dynamic Data Masking) is the name of the feature itself, not a masking function. The actual masking functions are DEFAULT, EMAIL, RANDOM, and PARTIAL."
    - id: "answer6"
      title: "FORMAT"
      correct: false
      explain: "FORMAT is not a valid dynamic data masking function in Microsoft Fabric. The available masking functions are DEFAULT, EMAIL, RANDOM, and PARTIAL."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that processes student payment information. Claire, a Database Security Specialist at MDFT Pro, manages a Fabric workspace called PaymentProcessing that contains a warehouse named StudentPayments. A team of data analysts has Viewer role access to the workspace to analyze payment trends and generate reports. Claire creates a table called CreditCard to store payment methods with columns for CreditCard (the card number) and CreditCardType (Visa, Mastercard, etc.). However, for compliance with PCI DSS security standards, the analysts should not be able to see full credit card numbers. They only need to see the first two characters and the last four characters (for example, "12XXXXXXXXXX5678" instead of "1234567890125678") to identify card types and verify transactions. Claire needs to implement dynamic data masking to protect the sensitive credit card data while still allowing analysts to perform their analysis.

How should Claire complete the ALTER TABLE statement to mask the CreditCard column?

```sql
ALTER TABLE dbo.CreditCard
ALTER COLUMN [CreditCard]
ADD MASKED WITH (FUNCTION = '________(2, "XXXXXXXXXX", 4)')
```
