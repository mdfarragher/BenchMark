title: "Select Loading Pattern for Creating Records"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Full"
      correct: false
      explain: "Full loading replaces all data in the target table with every load, which is inefficient for creating new records from incremental change files. This approach would discard historical versions and require processing 2 billion rows every 30 minutes, causing unnecessary load on the system."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Incremental"
      correct: true
      explain: "Incremental loading appends only new records from each change file to the target table. This pattern is ideal for creating new records because it processes only the changes (not the entire dataset), supports versioning by preserving historical records, and provides optimal performance when dealing with change data capture scenarios."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Snapshot"
      correct: false
      explain: "Snapshot loading creates a point-in-time copy of data but isn't designed for continuous incremental inserts. Snapshots are better suited for delete operations or creating read-only historical views, not for efficiently appending new records every 30 minutes."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that tracks student learning activity in real-time. Claire, a Data Platform Architect at MDFT Pro, manages a Fabric workspace containing a large table called StudentActivity with 2 billion rows storing historical student engagement data. The company's learning management system generates a change file every 30 minutes containing only the activities that occurred since the last file was generated (new course views, completed lessons, forum posts, etc.). Claire is designing a data pipeline that will automatically process each change file when it's generated and load the contents into the StudentActivity table. The solution must efficiently handle two types of operations: creating new records for student activities and deleting records when students withdraw from courses. Additionally, the system must support versioning to maintain a complete audit trail of all changes over time, allowing analysts to query historical states of the data. Claire needs to select the appropriate loading pattern for each operation type.

What loading pattern should Claire use for creating new records?
