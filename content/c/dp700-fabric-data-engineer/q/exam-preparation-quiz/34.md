title: "Select Loading Pattern for Deleting Records"
type: "question"

answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Full"
      correct: false
      explain: "Full loading replaces the entire table with new data, but it doesn't support versioning of deletions. When a record is deleted in a full load, all historical information about that record is lost, preventing audit trail capabilities and time-travel queries."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Incremental"
      correct: false
      explain: "Incremental loading is designed for appending new records, not for handling deletions. While incremental loads can mark records as deleted using flags, they don't naturally support the versioning and point-in-time querying needed for maintaining a complete audit trail of deleted records."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Snapshot"
      correct: true
      explain: "Snapshot loading creates point-in-time versions of data, making it ideal for delete operations that require versioning. When records are deleted, snapshots preserve the historical state, allowing queries against previous versions of the data. This enables full audit trails and supports time-travel queries to see data as it existed before deletions occurred."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that tracks student learning activity in real-time. Mark, a Data Platform Architect at MDFT Pro, manages a Fabric workspace containing a large table called StudentActivity with 2 billion rows storing historical student engagement data. The company's learning management system generates a change file every 30 minutes containing only the activities that occurred since the last file was generated (new course views, completed lessons, forum posts, etc.). Mark is designing a data pipeline that will automatically process each change file when it's generated and load the contents into the StudentActivity table. The solution must efficiently handle two types of operations: creating new records for student activities and deleting records when students withdraw from courses. Additionally, the system must support versioning to maintain a complete audit trail of all changes over time, allowing analysts to query historical states of the data. Mark needs to select the appropriate loading pattern for each operation type.

What loading pattern should Mark use for deleting existing records?
