title: "Understand Unconnected Pipeline Activity Behavior"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Execute procedure1 will run first, and then Copy_kdi will run"
      correct: false
      explain: "Without dependency connections (OnSuccess, OnFailure, or OnCompletion), there is no defined execution order between activities. The pipeline engine cannot determine which activity should run first without explicit dependencies linking them together."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Both activities will be skipped"
      correct: true
      explain: "When activities in a pipeline are not connected to each other or to a starting point with any dependency arrows, they have no triggering mechanism. Both activities will be skipped because there's no dependency chain that initiates their execution. Activities need either an OnSuccess, OnFailure, OnCompletion, or OnSkip dependency from a previous activity to execute."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Copy_kdi will run first, and then Execute procedure1 will run"
      correct: false
      explain: "Without dependency connections, there is no way for the pipeline to determine execution order based on activity names or types. The lack of connections means activities won't execute in any particular sequence."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Execute procedure1 will run and Copy_kdi will be skipped"
      correct: false
      explain: "Both activities are unconnected, so there's no mechanism to execute one while skipping the other. Without dependencies, neither activity will run."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "Both activities will run simultaneously"
      correct: false
      explain: "While unconnected activities with proper entry points can run in parallel, these activities have no dependency connections at all, meaning they lack a trigger to initiate execution. They will be skipped rather than run simultaneously."
    - id: "answer6"
      title: "Copy_kdi will run and Execute procedure1 will be skipped"
      correct: false
      explain: "Both activities are unconnected, so there's no mechanism to execute one while skipping the other. Without dependencies, neither activity will run."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that processes student enrollment data. Mark, a Data Integration Specialist at MDFT Pro, manages a Fabric workspace containing a data pipeline called StudentDataProcessor. The pipeline contains two activities as shown in the table below:

| Activity Name      | Type             | Description                               |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Execute procedure1 | Stored Procedure | Executes an Azure SQL DB stored procedure |
| Copy_kdi           | Copy data        | Copies CSV datafiles into OneLake         |

Mark has noticed that the two activities are NOT connected together with any dependency arrows (OnSuccess, OnError, or OnCompletion). The activities exist in the pipeline canvas but have no lines connecting them to each other or defining their execution relationships. Mark is wondering what will happen when the pipeline runs.

What will occur the next time StudentDataProcessor runs?
