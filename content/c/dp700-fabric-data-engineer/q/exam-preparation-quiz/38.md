title: "Find Eventstream Transformation Error Details"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Data insights"
      correct: false
      explain: "Data insights provides high-level metrics and statistics about data flowing through the eventstream, such as throughput, event counts, and performance trends. It doesn't show detailed error messages, occurrence times, or failure diagnostics for transformation errors."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Data preview"
      correct: false
      explain: "Data preview allows you to see sample data flowing through the eventstream to verify data formats and content. While useful for validating transformations, it doesn't display error details or failure information when transformations fail."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Details"
      correct: false
      explain: "The Details view shows configuration settings and properties of eventstream components, but it doesn't provide runtime error information. Details is used for reviewing and editing component configurations, not for troubleshooting transformation failures."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Runtime logs"
      correct: true
      explain: "Runtime logs display detailed error messages with three severity levels (warning, error, information), including the exact occurrence time of failures. This feature helps examine detailed logs generated by connector engines and transformation operations, making it essential for identifying the root cause of transformation failures."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that processes real-time student activity data. Mark, a Real-Time Analytics Engineer at MDFT Pro, manages an eventstream called StudentActivityStream that captures student quiz submissions, video completions, and forum interactions from the learning management system. The eventstream includes several transformations to enrich the data, filter out test accounts, and calculate engagement scores before routing the data to a KQL database and Power BI reports. Recently, Mark discovered that one of the transformations in StudentActivityStream is failing intermittently, causing some student activities to be lost. He needs to investigate the issue by finding detailed error information including the exact error messages, when the errors occurred, and any warnings that might indicate the root cause. This information will help him determine whether the failures are due to malformed input data, incorrect transformation logic, or resource constraints.

What should Mark use to find the error details, including the occurrence time?
