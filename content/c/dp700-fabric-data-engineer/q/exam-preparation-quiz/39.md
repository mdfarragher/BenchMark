title: "Find Total Number of Eventstream Errors"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Data insights"
      correct: false
      explain: "Data insights provides metrics about data flow and throughput but doesn't specifically aggregate error counts. It shows performance statistics and event processing rates rather than cumulative error totals."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Data preview"
      correct: false
      explain: "Data preview shows sample data flowing through the eventstream to help you verify transformations and data formats. It doesn't provide error statistics or total error counts for troubleshooting purposes."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Details"
      correct: true
      explain: "The Details view provides summary information about the eventstream component, including aggregated statistics such as the total number of errors that have occurred. This high-level overview helps you quickly assess the overall health and error rate of your eventstream transformations."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Runtime logs"
      correct: false
      explain: "While Runtime logs show individual error messages with timestamps and severity levels, they display errors as individual log entries rather than providing an aggregated count. Runtime logs are better for investigating specific error details rather than getting total error counts."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that processes real-time student activity data. Claire, a Real-Time Analytics Engineer at MDFT Pro, manages an eventstream called StudentActivityStream that captures student quiz submissions, video completions, and forum interactions from the learning management system. The eventstream includes several transformations to enrich the data, filter out test accounts, and calculate engagement scores before routing the data to a KQL database and Power BI reports. Recently, Claire discovered that one of the transformations in StudentActivityStream is failing intermittently, causing some student activities to be lost. After reviewing the detailed error messages and timestamps in the runtime logs, she now needs to understand the scope of the problem by determining the total number of errors that have occurred. This aggregate count will help her assess whether the issue is a rare anomaly or a systemic problem that requires immediate attention. The total error count will also be useful for tracking improvements after implementing fixes.

What should Claire use to find the total number of errors?
