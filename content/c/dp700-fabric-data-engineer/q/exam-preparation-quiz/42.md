title: "Resolve Direct Lake Performance Issues"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Change the MD5 hash to SHA256"
      correct: false
      explain: "Changing the hash algorithm from MD5 to SHA256 would increase computational overhead without improving query performance. The hash algorithm choice affects surrogate key generation but doesn't impact Direct Lake query performance or visual errors in Power BI reports."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Increase the capacity"
      correct: false
      explain: "While increasing capacity could temporarily improve performance by providing more compute resources, it doesn't address the root cause and would increase operational costs. The performance degradation is likely caused by the warehouse not having V-Order optimization enabled for Direct Lake queries."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Enable V-Order"
      correct: true
      explain: "V-Order is a write-time optimization to the parquet file format that enables lightning-fast reads under Microsoft Fabric compute engines including Power BI Direct Lake mode. Direct Lake mode depends on V-Order for optimal performance. Enabling V-Order will provide the best query performance without increasing costs, making it the ideal solution for Direct Lake-based reports showing year-over-year data."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Modify the surrogate keys to use a different data type"
      correct: false
      explain: "Changing the surrogate key data type might reduce storage slightly but won't significantly improve query performance for Direct Lake reports. The MD5 hash produces a unique identifier, and changing the data type doesn't address the underlying optimization issue affecting report performance."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "Create views"
      correct: false
      explain: "Creating views would add an additional abstraction layer that could potentially slow down queries rather than improve performance. Views don't provide the file-level optimizations needed for Direct Lake mode to perform efficiently on large fact tables."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that operates on an F32 Fabric capacity. Claire, a Business Intelligence Architect at MDFT Pro, manages a workspace containing a warehouse named StudentMetricsWarehouse that stores historical student performance data. The warehouse is modeled using MD5 hash surrogate keys for efficient data integration from multiple source systems. StudentMetricsWarehouse contains a single fact table called FactStudentAssessments that has grown substantially from 200 million rows to 500 million rows during the past year as MDFT Pro expanded its course offerings. Power BI reports based on Direct Lake mode query this warehouse to show year-over-year comparison of student pass rates, course completion times, and assessment scores. Recently, users have reported that the performance of some reports has degraded noticeably over time, with some visuals showing errors or timing out when loading data. Claire needs to resolve these performance issues while providing the best query performance and minimizing operational costs.

Which should Claire do?
