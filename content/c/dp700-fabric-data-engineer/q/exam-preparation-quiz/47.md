title: "Identify Items Deployed in Deployment Pipeline"
type: "question"

answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Data from the semantic models will be deployed to the target stage"
      correct: false
      explain: "Semantic models are Fabric items that contain both data and metadata, but during deployment only the metadata is copied to the target stage while the data isn't transferred. After deployment, the semantic model in the target workspace might not have any data and will require a refresh to populate it with data."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "The Dataflow Gen1 dataflows will be deployed to the target stage"
      correct: true
      explain: "Dataflows, both Gen1 and Gen2, are fully supported in Microsoft Fabric deployment pipelines. Dataflow Gen1 items will be deployed to the target workspace, and you can create deployment rules to manage data source configurations across pipeline stages. However, note that if a dataflow is being refreshed during deployment, the deployment will fail."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "The scheduled refresh policies will be deployed to the target stage"
      correct: false
      explain: "Scheduled refresh policies are not carried over when items are deployed through deployment pipelines. After deploying semantic models or dataflows to the target workspace, you must manually configure the scheduled refresh policies in the target stage. Only incremental refresh policies for semantic models are copied during deployment."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "The Dataflow Gen2 dataflows will be deployed to the target stage"
      correct: false
      explain: "While Dataflow Gen2 dataflows are fully supported and will deploy successfully to the target stage, the statement lists only two Dataflow Gen1 dataflows in the source workspace, not three Dataflow Gen2 dataflows. This answer option would be incorrect based on the workspace contents."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that develops analytics solutions across development and production environments. Mark, a DevOps Engineer at MDFT Pro, manages a Fabric workspace named StudentAnalytics_DEV that contains the following items:

- 10 reports showing student performance metrics
- 4 notebooks for data processing and transformation
- 3 lakehouses storing student activity and assessment data
- 2 data pipelines orchestrating ETL workflows
- 2 Dataflow Gen1 dataflows for data extraction and cleansing
- 3 Dataflow Gen2 dataflows for advanced transformations
- 5 semantic models that each has a scheduled refresh policy configured

Mark creates a deployment pipeline named PromotionPipeline to move items from StudentAnalytics_DEV to a new workspace named StudentAnalytics_TEST for quality assurance testing. He successfully deploys all items from StudentAnalytics_DEV to StudentAnalytics_TEST using the deployment pipeline. Mark needs to understand which items and configurations were successfully transferred to the target workspace so he can properly configure the TEST environment.

Which of the following statements are true about what was deployed to StudentAnalytics_TEST?
