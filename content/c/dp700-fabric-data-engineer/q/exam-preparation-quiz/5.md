title: "Monitor and Visualize Semantic Model Refresh History"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "A notebook"
      correct: true
      explain: "A notebook using the semantic link library can programmatically retrieve refresh history data using the list_refresh_requests function and create custom visualizations. This approach allows you to analyze trends, compare multiple refreshes, and create detailed charts showing refresh duration and success rates."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "The refresh history from the settings of Model1"
      correct: false
      explain: "While the semantic model settings do show refresh history, this view only displays tabular data without visualization capabilities. It provides basic information about past refreshes but cannot create charts or perform trend analysis."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "A Dataflow Gen2 dataflow"
      correct: false
      explain: "Dataflow Gen2 is designed for data transformation and ingestion, not for monitoring or visualizing semantic model refresh history. It does not have built-in capabilities to access or analyze refresh metadata."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "A data pipeline"
      correct: false
      explain: "Data pipelines are used for orchestrating data workflows and can trigger semantic model refreshes, but they are not designed to monitor refresh history or create visualizations of that data."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that provides data analytics training worldwide. Mark, the Data Analytics Instructor, manages a semantic model called **CourseMetrics** that contains student enrollment, course completion, and instructor performance data. The model is refreshed multiple times daily to provide up-to-date information for the company's management dashboards. 

Recently, some refreshes have been taking longer than expected, and Mark needs to investigate the refresh patterns to identify potential performance issues. He wants to analyze the refresh history over the past month, comparing refresh durations and success rates, and visualize this data in charts to identify trends and anomalies. 

The solution should allow him to create custom visualizations that show refresh duration over time and highlight any failed refreshes. What should Mark use to monitor the refresh history of **CourseMetrics** and visualize it in a chart?
