title: "Configure Dynamic Data Masking for Date Column"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "default()"
      correct: true
      explain: "The default() masking function is the correct choice for masking date columns. When applied to DATE or DATETIME fields, default() masks the values to display as 1900-01-01 (January 1, 1900), which meets the requirement. The default() function is versatile and can be applied to text, numeric, and date fields, automatically choosing the appropriate masking behavior based on the data type."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "default(1900-01-01)"
      correct: false
      explain: "The default() function does not accept parameters. It automatically determines the appropriate masking behavior based on the column's data type. For date columns, it masks values to 1900-01-01 by default, but you cannot specify a custom default value as a parameter."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "partial(1900-01-01)"
      correct: false
      explain: "The partial() function is designed for partial masking of string data, showing a specified number of characters at the beginning and end while masking the middle portion. It cannot be used for date masking and does not accept date values as parameters."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "email()"
      correct: false
      explain: "The email() function is specifically designed for masking email addresses. It masks the first character and the domain (before @), showing only the first letter and the suffix .com. This function cannot be used for date columns."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "random(1900-01-01)"
      correct: false
      explain: "The random() function requires two parameters (start range and end range) and is designed exclusively for numeric data types. It cannot accept date values or be used with date columns. Additionally, this syntax is missing the second required parameter."
    - id: "answer6"
      title: "random(1900-01-01, 1900-01-01)"
      correct: false
      explain: "The random() function is designed exclusively for numeric data types to mask values with a random number within a specified range. It cannot accept date values as parameters and cannot be used for date column masking. For date masking, use the default() function instead."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that maintains student records in a Fabric warehouse. Claire, a Security Engineer at MDFT Pro, manages a workspace containing a warehouse named StudentRecordsWarehouse. The warehouse contains a table named DimStudents with the following columns:

- StudentName
- StudentID
- BirthDate
- Email

Due to privacy regulations and data protection requirements, Claire needs to configure security to mask sensitive student information. The BirthDate column contains personally identifiable information that must be protected from unauthorized access. When users without UNMASK permissions query the DimStudents table, the BirthDate values must be masked and display as 1900-01-01 instead of the actual birth dates. This approach allows analysts to work with the table structure without exposing sensitive date information.

How should Claire complete the statement to mask the BirthDate column?

```sql
ALTER TABLE DimStudents
ALTER COLUMN BirthDate
ADD MASKED WITH (FUNCTION = '____________')
```
