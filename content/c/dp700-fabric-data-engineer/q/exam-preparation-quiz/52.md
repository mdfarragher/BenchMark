title: "Choose Orchestration Solution for Sequential Loading"

      title: "Dataflow Gen2 dataflow"
      correct: false
      explain: "Dataflow Gen2 dataflows are designed for data transformation and loading, but they focus on individual data flow operations rather than orchestrating multiple items sequentially. While dataflows can be scheduled, they don't provide the activity chaining and dependency management needed to ensure items load one after the other in a specific sequence."

      title: "Warehouse"
      correct: false
      explain: "A warehouse is a data storage and analytics solution, not an orchestration tool. Warehouses store structured data and support SQL queries, but they don't provide scheduling or workflow orchestration capabilities to load items sequentially."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Notebook"
      correct: false
      explain: "While you could write custom code in a notebook to orchestrate sequential loading, notebooks themselves don't provide built-in scheduling at 15-minute intervals or native orchestration features. You would need to wrap the notebook in a pipeline or use external scheduling mechanisms, making this approach more complex than necessary."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Data pipeline"
      correct: true
      explain: "A data pipeline is the correct choice for orchestrating sequential data loading. Pipelines allow you to chain activities together using OnSuccess dependencies to ensure items load one after the other in sequence. You can schedule pipelines to run at specific intervals (such as every 15 minutes) using the Schedule option in the Home ribbon. Data Factory pipelines provide comprehensive orchestration capabilities for running multiple data movements and transformations in a coordinated workflow."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that processes student enrollment data from multiple source systems. Mark, a Data Integration Engineer at MDFT Pro, needs to develop an orchestration solution in Fabric that will load student data sequentially through multiple stages. The solution must load each data item one after the other to maintain referential integrity and ensure that dependent data loads in the correct order. For example, student records must load before enrollment records, which must load before course completion records. Additionally, the entire orchestration workflow must be scheduled to run automatically every 15 minutes throughout the business day to keep the analytics platform synchronized with the source systems. Mark needs to choose the appropriate Fabric item type that supports both sequential execution control and scheduled automation.

Which type of item should Mark use for this orchestration solution?
