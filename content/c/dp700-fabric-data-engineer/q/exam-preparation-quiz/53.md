title: "Enable Spark Job Access to Azure SQL Database"
type: "question"

answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "An on-premises data gateway"
      correct: false
      explain: "An on-premises data gateway is used to securely connect to on-premises data sources from cloud services, not for accessing Azure cloud resources like Azure SQL Database. Since the database is in Azure (not on-premises), an on-premises data gateway is not the appropriate solution."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "A managed private endpoint"
      correct: true
      explain: "A managed private endpoint is the correct solution for enabling Spark job definitions to access Azure SQL Database with public internet access disabled. Managed private endpoints support various Azure data sources including Azure SQL Database and work with Fabric Spark workloads such as notebooks, lakehouses, and Spark job definitions. Once the private endpoint status changes to approved, the Spark job definition can securely connect to the Azure SQL Database through the private network without requiring public internet access."

      title: "An integration runtime"
      correct: false
      explain: "Integration runtime is an Azure Data Factory and Synapse Analytics concept used for data integration across different network environments. Microsoft Fabric doesn't use integration runtimes; instead, it uses managed virtual networks and managed private endpoints for secure connectivity to Azure resources."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "A data management gateway"
      correct: false
      explain: "Data management gateway is a legacy term from older Microsoft data services. In modern Microsoft Fabric, the appropriate solution for private connectivity to Azure resources is managed private endpoints, which provide secure access to Azure services like Azure SQL Database without exposing them to the public internet."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that processes student assessment data using advanced analytics. Claire, a Data Engineering Architect at MDFT Pro, manages a Fabric workspace named AnalyticsWorkspace that contains an Apache Spark job definition named AssessmentScoreProcessor. The company maintains an Azure SQL database named StudentAssessmentDB that contains detailed assessment results, quiz scores, and competency evaluations. For security and compliance reasons, StudentAssessmentDB has public internet access disabled and can only be accessed through private network connectivity. Claire needs to ensure that AssessmentScoreProcessor can securely access the data in StudentAssessmentDB to perform advanced scoring calculations and generate student performance insights. The solution must work with the existing security configuration that prohibits public internet access to the database.

What should Claire create to enable AssessmentScoreProcessor to access StudentAssessmentDB?
