answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Data Pipeline"
      correct: false
      explain: "Data pipelines are designed for batch data orchestration and ETL workflows, not for real-time streaming scenarios. While data pipelines can move data between environments, they don't leverage the team's existing Azure Stream Analytics and Event Hubs expertise."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Dataflow Gen2"
      correct: false
      explain: "Dataflow Gen2 is a low-code data transformation tool optimized for Power Query users, not for teams experienced with stream processing. It doesn't provide the real-time streaming capabilities that align with Azure Stream Analytics and Event Hubs expertise."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Eventstream"
      correct: true
      explain: "Eventstream is the ideal choice because it provides real-time event streaming capabilities similar to Azure Stream Analytics and natively integrates with Azure Event Hubs. Teams with Azure Stream Analytics and Event Hubs experience can easily transition to Eventstream, as it uses similar concepts and can directly connect to existing Event Hubs sources."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Notebook"
      correct: false
      explain: "Notebooks require coding skills in Python, Scala, or R and are more suited for data science and advanced analytics workflows. They don't provide the declarative stream processing approach that Azure Stream Analytics users are familiar with."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that offers certification preparation courses. Claire, a Solutions Architect at MDFT Pro, is planning three data engineering projects and needs to select appropriate Microsoft Fabric items for each project team. Each team has different technical backgrounds and requirements. The first project team specializes in Azure Stream Analytics and Azure Event Hubs and needs to move real-time student activity data between different environments (development, testing, and production). The project requires processing continuous streams of student engagement events, including course views, quiz submissions, and forum posts. The solution should minimize the learning curve for the team and leverage their existing streaming expertise.

| Project   | Project Requirement                  | Project Team Skillset                       |
|-----------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Project 1 | Move data between environments       | Azure Stream Analytics and Azure Event Hubs |
| Project 2 | Transform data with a low-code approach | Microsoft Power BI                       |
| Project 3 | Transform data                       | R Language                                  |

What should Claire recommend for Project 1?
