title: "Make Python Libraries Available To Notebooks"

    - id: "answer1"
      title: "1. Change the runtime version, 2. Install the libraries, 3. Set the default environment"
      correct: false
      explain: "Changing the runtime version is not necessary for making custom libraries available to notebooks. The correct first step is to create an environment."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "1. Install the libraries, 2. Create an environment, 3. Set the default environment"
      correct: false
      explain: "You must create an environment first before you can install libraries into it. Installing libraries without an environment context won't make them available by default to new notebooks."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "1. Create a pool, 2. Install the libraries, 3. Set the default environment"
      correct: false
      explain: "Creating a pool is not required for making libraries available to notebooks in Fabric. Environments, not pools, are used to manage library dependencies in Fabric workspaces."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "1. Create an environment, 2. Install the libraries, 3. Set the default environment"
      correct: true
      explain: "This is the correct sequence. First, you create an environment to serve as a container for your libraries. Then, you install the Python libraries into that environment. Finally, you set it as the default environment for the workspace so all new notebooks automatically use it."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "1. Create an environment, 2. Set the default environment, 3. Install the libraries"
      correct: false
      explain: "While creating an environment is the correct first step, you must install the libraries into the environment before setting it as the default, otherwise the default environment would not contain the required libraries."
    - id: "answer6"
      title: "1. Create an environment, 2. Create a pool, 3. Install the libraries"
      correct: false
      explain: "Creating a pool is not necessary for making libraries available to notebooks. After creating an environment and installing libraries, you need to set the environment as default, not create a pool."

You work as a Development Manager for Mark at MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency. MDFT Pro has a team of developers who have created Python libraries containing reusable code for transforming student enrollment data, course analytics, and performance metrics. Mark has asked you to set up a Fabric workspace named Workspace1 that will be used by the development team to build extract, transform, and load (ETL) solutions using notebooks for processing MDFT Pro's educational data. To streamline the development process and ensure consistency across the team, you need to make sure that these custom Python libraries are automatically available by default to all new notebooks created in Workspace1, so developers don't have to manually install them each time they create a new notebook.

Which three actions should you perform in sequence?
