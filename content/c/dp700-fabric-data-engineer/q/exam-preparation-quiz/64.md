answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Hopping"
      correct: false
      explain: "Hopping windows can overlap because they have a fixed size and a hop interval that can be smaller than the window size, allowing events to belong to multiple windows, which doesn't meet the requirement."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Sliding"
      correct: false
      explain: "Sliding windows create a new window whenever an event occurs, resulting in overlapping windows where events can belong to multiple windows, which violates the requirement that each event must belong to exactly one window."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Session"
      correct: false
      explain: "Session windows group events based on activity periods separated by gaps of inactivity, resulting in variable-length windows that are not fixed to one-minute intervals as required."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Tumbling"
      correct: true
      explain: "Tumbling windows create fixed-size, non-overlapping, and contiguous time intervals where each event belongs to exactly one window, perfectly matching the requirement for one-minute groupings of car speed data."

You work as a Traffic Data Analyst for Mark at MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency. MDFT Pro operates a Fabric workspace that contains an eventstream named EventStream1, which processes real-time traffic data from motorway sensors installed near the agency's training facilities. This streaming data represents the speed of cars passing by the sensors and is output to a table named Table1 in a lakehouse for further analysis. Mark has requested that you add a transformation to EventStream1 to calculate the average car speeds for traffic pattern analysis used in MDFT Pro's driver training courses. The requirement specifies that speeds must be grouped by non-overlapping and contiguous time intervals of one minute, and each speed event must belong to exactly one time window to ensure accurate statistics.

Which windowing function should you use?
