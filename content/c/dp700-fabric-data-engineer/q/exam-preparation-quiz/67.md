answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "A Dataflow Gen1 dataflow"
      correct: false
      explain: "Dataflow Gen1 is primarily designed for data transformation and loading into Power BI datasets, not for direct loading into Fabric warehouses. Dataflow Gen2 would be more appropriate, but a data pipeline is the recommended approach for warehouse loads."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "A data pipeline"
      correct: true
      explain: "Data pipelines in Fabric support the Copy Data activity, which can connect to on-premises SQL Server through a data gateway and efficiently copy data to a Fabric warehouse. This is the recommended approach for warehouse data ingestion."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "A KQL queryset"
      correct: false
      explain: "KQL querysets are used for querying data in KQL databases or Real-Time Analytics, not for copying data from on-premises SQL Server to a Fabric warehouse."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "A notebook"
      correct: false
      explain: "While notebooks can be used to copy data, they require custom code and are not the recommended approach for simple data copy operations. Data pipelines provide a more robust, no-code solution with better monitoring and error handling."

You work as a Data Migration Specialist for Mark at MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency. MDFT Pro operates a Fabric workspace that contains a warehouse named Warehouse1, which is being set up to consolidate all the agency's reporting data. Currently, MDFT Pro has an on-premises Microsoft SQL Server database named Database1 that stores legacy student enrollment records, course schedules, and trainer assignments. This on-premises database is accessible through an on-premises data gateway that has already been configured. Mark has tasked you with migrating the data from Database1 to Warehouse1 to enable modern analytics and reporting capabilities for the training agency's operations team.

Which item should you use to copy the data?
