answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Data Pipeline"
      correct: false
      explain: "Data pipelines are designed for orchestrating data workflows and require configuring various activities and connections. While they support some visual configuration, they don't provide the low-code Power Query interface that Power BI users are familiar with."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Dataflow Gen2"
      correct: true
      explain: "Dataflow Gen2 is the perfect choice because it uses the same Power Query interface that Power BI users already know. It provides a familiar, low-code visual experience for data transformation with drag-and-drop operations, allowing the team to leverage their existing Power BI skills without requiring extensive coding knowledge."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Eventstream"
      correct: false
      explain: "Eventstream is designed for real-time streaming data scenarios, not batch data transformations. While it has some transformation capabilities, it doesn't provide the comprehensive low-code Power Query interface that Power BI users are accustomed to."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Notebook"
      correct: false
      explain: "Notebooks require coding skills in Python, PySpark, SQL, or R and are not a low-code solution. They would require the Power BI team to learn programming languages, which contradicts the requirement to minimize development effort."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that offers certification preparation courses. Mark, a Project Manager at MDFT Pro, is planning three data engineering projects and needs to select appropriate Microsoft Fabric items for each project team. The second project team consists of Power BI developers who specialize in creating reports and dashboards using Power Query for data preparation. They need to transform student enrollment data from multiple sources (CSV files, SQL databases, and web APIs) into a unified format for analysis. The transformations include cleaning data, merging tables, filtering records, and creating calculated columns. The team wants to use a low-code approach that leverages their existing Power BI and Power Query expertise to minimize the learning curve and development time.

| Project   | Project Requirement                  | Project Team Skillset                       |
|-----------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Project 1 | Move data between environments       | Azure Stream Analytics and Azure Event Hubs |
| Project 2 | Transform data with a low-code approach | Microsoft Power BI                       |
| Project 3 | Transform data                       | R Language                                  |

What should Mark recommend for Project 2?
