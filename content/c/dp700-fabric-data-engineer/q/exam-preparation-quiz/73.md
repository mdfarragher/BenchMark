You work as a Security Administrator for Mark at MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency. MDFT Pro operates a Fabric warehouse named DW1 that stores comprehensive sales data for all training courses, certification programs, and educational materials sold by the agency. The warehouse contains a table that is used by multiple sales representatives across different regions and product lines. Mark has identified a security concern: currently, all sales representatives can see the entire sales dataset, including sales made by other representatives in different territories. To comply with data privacy policies and ensure appropriate data access, Mark has asked you to implement row-level security (RLS) so that each sales representative can see only their own sales records and cannot access data belonging to other representatives.

Which warehouse object do you require to implement row-level security?
