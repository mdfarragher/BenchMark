      title: "Data from the semantic models will be deployed, Dataflow Gen1 dataflows will be deployed, Scheduled refresh policies will be deployed"
      correct: false
      explain: "Deployment pipelines only deploy metadata and definitions, not the actual data from semantic models. Additionally, scheduled refresh policies are not deployed to the target workspace."

      title: "Data from the semantic models will be deployed, Dataflow Gen1 dataflows will be deployed, Scheduled refresh policies will NOT be deployed"
      correct: false
      explain: "While Dataflow Gen1 dataflows are deployed, the actual data from semantic models is not deployed. Deployment pipelines only deploy the structure and definitions of items, not their data content."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Data from the semantic models will NOT be deployed, Dataflow Gen1 dataflows will be deployed, Scheduled refresh policies will be deployed"
      correct: false
      explain: "While semantic model data is not deployed, scheduled refresh policies are also not deployed to the target workspace. Only the Dataflow Gen1 dataflows themselves (their definitions) are deployed."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Data from the semantic models will NOT be deployed, Dataflow Gen1 dataflows will be deployed, Scheduled refresh policies will NOT be deployed"
      correct: true
      explain: "Deployment pipelines deploy item definitions and metadata, not the actual data. Dataflow Gen1 dataflow definitions are deployed to the target workspace, but the data in semantic models is not copied, and scheduled refresh policies must be reconfigured in the target workspace."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "Data from the semantic models will NOT be deployed, Dataflow Gen1 dataflows will NOT be deployed, Scheduled refresh policies will NOT be deployed"
      correct: false
      explain: "Dataflow Gen1 dataflows are supported items that will be deployed to the target workspace. Their definitions and configurations are copied during the deployment process."

You work as a DevOps Engineer for Mark at MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency. MDFT Pro operates a Fabric workspace named Workspace1_DEV that serves as the development environment for all analytics and data engineering work. This workspace contains a comprehensive set of resources including 10 reports for student analytics, 4 notebooks for data processing, 3 lakehouses storing course and enrollment data, 2 data pipelines for ETL operations, 2 Dataflow Gen1 dataflows for legacy data transformations, 3 Dataflow Gen2 dataflows for modern data flows, and 5 semantic models each configured with scheduled refresh policies to keep dashboards up to date. Mark has asked you to set up a proper development lifecycle by creating a deployment pipeline named Pipeline1 to promote items from the development workspace to a new testing workspace named Workspace1_TEST. You have successfully deployed all items from Workspace1_DEV to Workspace1_TEST using the deployment pipeline.

Which of the following statements are true about what gets deployed?

**A.** Data from the semantic models will be deployed to the target site

**B.** The Dataflow Gen1 dataflows will be deployed to the target site

**C.** The scheduled refresh policies will be deployed to the target site

Which combination is correct?
