      title: "GitHub Actions"
      correct: false
      explain: "GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform for GitHub repositories that can automate workflows, but it's not integrated with Fabric deployment pipelines for deploying Fabric workspace items like eventhouses."

      title: "A deployment pipeline"
      correct: true
      explain: "Fabric deployment pipelines are the native tool for deploying Fabric items including eventhouses across Dev, Test, and Prod workspaces. The eventhouse can be added to the existing deployment pipeline and will be deployed alongside other workspace items."

      title: "An Azure DevOps pipeline"
      correct: false
      explain: "Azure DevOps pipelines are designed for general CI/CD workflows and code deployments, but they don't natively support deploying Fabric workspace items like eventhouses. Fabric deployment pipelines are the appropriate tool for this task."

      title: "A data pipeline"
      correct: false
      explain: "Data pipelines in Fabric are used for orchestrating data movement and transformation activities, not for deploying Fabric items across workspaces. They serve a different purpose than deployment pipelines."

You work as a Release Manager for Mark at MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency. MDFT Pro has established a robust development lifecycle using a Fabric deployment pipeline that manages three workspaces: Dev for development work, Test for quality assurance testing, and Prod for production deployments serving real users. The deployment pipeline currently handles various Fabric items including reports, notebooks, lakehouses, and data pipelines. Mark has recently created a new eventhouse in the Dev workspace to support real-time analytics on student engagement data and course completion metrics. This eventhouse needs to be promoted through the Test environment for validation before being deployed to the Prod workspace for use by the analytics team. You need to incorporate this eventhouse into the existing deployment process to ensure it follows the same quality gates as other Fabric items.

What should you use to add the eventhouse to the deployment process?
