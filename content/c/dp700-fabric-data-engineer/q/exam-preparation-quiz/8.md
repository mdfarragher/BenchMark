You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that provides real-time analytics for student performance tracking. Mark, the Real-Time Intelligence Specialist, manages an eventhouse that stores streaming data from online learning platforms, including student quiz results, video watch time, and forum activity. 

The eventhouse contains multiple KQL databases with several months of historical data. Recently, the training team requested access to this data through OneLake file explorer so they can analyze it using Fabric lakehouse notebooks and create Power BI reports. However, when they attempt to browse the data through OneLake file explorer, they cannot see any data from the eventhouse. Mark enables **OneLake Availability** for the eventhouse to make the data accessible.

What data will be copied to OneLake after Mark enables this feature?
