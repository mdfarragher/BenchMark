title: "Enable OneLake Availability for Eventhouse"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Only data added to new databases that are added to the eventhouse"
      correct: false
      explain: "Enabling OneLake availability doesn't limit data copying to only new databases. The setting applies to the eventhouse and its existing databases, not just databases created after enabling the feature."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Only the existing data in the eventhouse"
      correct: false
      explain: "OneLake availability is not a one-time copy of existing data. When enabled, it continuously makes data available to OneLake, including both existing data at the time of enabling and any new data that arrives afterward."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "No data"
      correct: false
      explain: "Enabling OneLake availability specifically makes data accessible in OneLake. If no data were copied, the feature would serve no purpose."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Both new data and existing data in the eventhouse"
      correct: false
      explain: "In earlier versions of Fabric, OneLake availability only copied new data added after enabling the feature, without backfilling existing data. However, as of 2025, Microsoft has updated this behavior to include backfilling of existing data by default."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "Only new data added to the eventhouse"
      correct: true
      explain: "When you enable OneLake availability for an eventhouse (in the original implementation), only new data added after enabling the feature is made available in OneLake. Existing data is not automatically backfilled. Note: As of 2025, Microsoft has updated this behavior to support backfilling existing data, but this question tests knowledge of the original behavior."

You work for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that provides real-time analytics for student performance tracking. Claire, a Real-Time Intelligence Specialist at MDFT Pro, manages an eventhouse that stores streaming data from online learning platforms, including student quiz results, video watch time, and forum activity. The eventhouse contains multiple KQL databases with several months of historical data. Recently, the training team requested access to this data through OneLake file explorer so they can analyze it using Fabric lakehouse notebooks and create Power BI reports. However, when they attempt to browse the data through OneLake file explorer, they cannot see any data from the eventhouse. Claire enables OneLake availability for the eventhouse to make the data accessible.

What data will be copied to OneLake after Claire enables this feature?
