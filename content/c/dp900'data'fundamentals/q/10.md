    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Yes"
      correct: true
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "No"
      explain: "Semi-structured data is specifically designed to accommodate highly variable structures. Unlike structured data with fixed schemas, semi-structured data can store entities with different fields, data types, and structures within the same dataset."

      title: "Only in NoSQL databases"
      explain: "While NoSQL databases are commonly used for semi-structured data, the ability to store variable structures is inherent to semi-structured data formats themselves, regardless of the storage technology used."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Only with proper indexing"
      explain: "The flexibility to store variable structures in semi-structured data is not dependent on indexing. This capability is a fundamental characteristic of semi-structured data formats, though indexing can improve query performance."

MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency, operates a diverse student management system that serves learners with vastly different backgrounds and requirements. The academy offers various certification paths, from basic Azure fundamentals to advanced specialty certifications, each requiring different student profile information and tracking different progress metrics.

Claire, the data architect at MDFT Academy, is designing a system to store student profiles that can accommodate significant structural variations. Some students may have multiple previous certifications, various contact methods, and extensive learning histories, while others might be new learners with minimal profile information. Mark, the database designer, suggests using semi-structured data to handle these varying requirements. 

Evaluate the following statement: "You can use semi-structured data to store data that has a highly variable structure." Is this correct?
