MDFT Academy has accumulated vast amounts of training data over the years, including student assessment results, course feedback, video viewing patterns, and interactive lab completion metrics. The academy's data science team needs to process this big data to gain insights into learning effectiveness and optimize their curriculum delivery.

Claire, the technical director at MDFT Academy, is evaluating different Azure services to handle their big data processing requirements. The team needs a solution that can provision and manage clusters of open-source analytics tools like Apache Spark for machine learning on student data, Hadoop for distributed storage and processing of historical records, and Kafka for streaming real-time student interaction data. 

Mark, the data architect, needs to recommend the most appropriate Azure service for this requirement. What should Mark recommend?
