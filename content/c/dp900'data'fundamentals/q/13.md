    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Yes"
      correct: true
      explain: "Both XML and JSON are excellent formats for storing semi-structured data. They provide the flexibility to handle varying data structures, support hierarchical relationships, can accommodate optional fields, and allow for nested data structures. JSON is lightweight and widely used in modern applications, while XML offers additional features like namespaces and schema validation."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "No"
      explain: "This statement is incorrect because both XML and JSON are indeed suitable file formats for storing semi-structured data, providing the flexibility needed to handle varying data structures."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Only XML can be used"
      explain: "This is incorrect because JSON is also an excellent format for semi-structured data storage and is often preferred for its simplicity and lightweight nature compared to XML."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Only JSON can be used"
      explain: "This is incorrect because XML is also a valid format for semi-structured data storage, offering features like namespaces, attributes, and schema validation that can be valuable in certain scenarios."

MDFT Pro collects diverse types of training data from multiple sources including course catalogs, student profiles, assessment results, and feedback forms. The data structure varies significantly between different systems and doesn't fit neatly into traditional relational database tables, as some records have optional fields while others contain nested information.

Mark, the data architect at MDFT Pro, is designing a data storage strategy that can accommodate this variability in data structure. Claire, the technical director, has suggested using file formats that support semi-structured data to maintain flexibility while preserving the hierarchical relationships in their educational data.

Can XML and JSON be used as file formats to store semi-structured data?
