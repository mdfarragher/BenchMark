MDFT Academy collects diverse types of training data from multiple sources including course catalogs, student profiles, assessment results, and feedback forms. The data structure varies significantly between different systems and doesn't fit neatly into traditional relational database tables, as some records have optional fields while others contain nested information.

Mark, the data architect at MDFT Academy, is designing a data storage strategy that can accommodate this variability in data structure. Claire, the technical director, has suggested using file formats that support semi-structured data to maintain flexibility while preserving the hierarchical relationships in their educational data. The team needs to evaluate whether XML and JSON are appropriate formats for storing this type of semi-structured data.
