      title: "Allows you to select the underlying hardware and operating system"
      explain: "Azure File storage is a fully managed serverless service where Microsoft handles all underlying infrastructure. You can only choose between standard HDD and premium SSD performance tiers, but not the specific hardware or operating system."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Is the recommended storage solution for key/value storage implementation"
      explain: "Azure File storage provides hierarchical file system access, not key/value storage. Microsoft recommends Azure Cosmos DB Core (SQL) API or Azure Table storage for key/value storage scenarios."

      title: "Supports direct mounting by Windows, MacOS, and Linux"
      correct: true
      explain: "Azure File storage provides cross-platform compatibility and can be directly mounted as a network drive on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems using the SMB (Server Message Block) protocol. This capability makes it seamless to integrate with existing applications and workflows across different operating systems."

      title: "Supports redundancy across multiple regions by default"
      explain: "Azure File storage defaults to locally-redundant storage (LRS) within a single region. Multi-region redundancy options like geo-redundant storage (GRS) are available but must be explicitly configured and are not the default setting."
