      title: "Yes"
      correct: true
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "No"
      explain: "This is incorrect because Vehicle clearly represents a distinct real-world object with specific attributes (license plate, make, model, color, year purchased), making it a valid data entity in the data model."

      title: "Only if it has a primary key"
      explain: "While having a primary key is important for database implementation, an entity is defined by representing a real-world object with attributes, regardless of key designation. Vehicle meets this definition with its specific characteristics."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Only if it relates to other entities"
      explain: "A data entity is defined by modeling a real-world object with attributes, not by its relationships to other entities. While Vehicle does relate to other entities like Rental, it would still be an entity on its own."

MDFT Academy operates a vehicle fleet to transport students to off-site training locations and practical certification labs. The academy maintains detailed records of their vehicles to ensure proper maintenance scheduling, insurance compliance, and efficient resource allocation for their educational programs.

Mark, the fleet administrator at MDFT Academy, has created a comprehensive vehicle tracking system stored in a spreadsheet. Each vehicle record contains the license plate number, manufacturer (make), specific model, color, and the year it was purchased by the academy. Claire, a new data analyst on the team, is learning about data modeling concepts and needs to understand how real-world objects are represented in data systems. She's examining the vehicle tracking system to understand fundamental data modeling principles.
