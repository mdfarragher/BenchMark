MDFT Pro processes student data from multiple sources including their learning management system, assessment platforms, and external certification tracking systems. The academy needs to integrate this data and export it to various destinations for different analytical and operational purposes across their educational infrastructure.

Claire, the data integration specialist at MDFT Pro, is designing ETL pipelines using Azure Data Factory to move student performance data between systems. The academy needs to export processed data to their data warehouse in Azure Synapse Analytics for reporting, to Azure Data Lake Storage for long-term archival, to Azure SQL Database for operational dashboards, and to Azure Cosmos DB for real-time student recommendation engines. Mark, the technical director, needs to verify the range of export destinations that Azure Data Factory supports.

What types of destinations can Azure Data Factory export data to?
