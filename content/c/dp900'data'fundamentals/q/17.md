MDFT Academy processes student data from multiple sources including their learning management system, assessment platforms, and external certification tracking systems. The academy needs to integrate this data and export it to various destinations for different analytical and operational purposes across their educational infrastructure.

Claire, the data integration specialist at MDFT Academy, is designing ETL pipelines using Azure Data Factory to move student performance data between systems. The academy needs to export processed data to their data warehouse in Azure Synapse Analytics for reporting, to Azure Data Lake Storage for long-term archival, to Azure SQL Database for operational dashboards, and to Azure Cosmos DB for real-time student recommendation engines. Mark, the technical director, needs to verify whether Azure Data Factory can support all these diverse export destinations.
