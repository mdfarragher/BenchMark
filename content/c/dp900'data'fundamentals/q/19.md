    - id: "answer2"
      title: "No"
      explain: "This is incorrect because the license plate serves as a unique identifier for each vehicle and can be used to establish relationships between the vehicle entity and other related entities, making it function as a key value."

      title: "Only if it's the primary key"
      explain: "A key value doesn't need to be designated as the primary key to function as a key. The license plate's uniqueness and its role in identifying vehicles and establishing relationships qualifies it as a key value regardless of its formal designation."

MDFT Academy operates a vehicle fleet management system to coordinate transportation for students attending off-site certification labs and training facilities. The academy maintains detailed vehicle records and tracks vehicle usage through a rental tracking system that records which vehicles are assigned to specific training events and field trips.

Mark, the fleet coordinator at MDFT Academy, has designed a data system where vehicle information is stored in one spreadsheet and vehicle rental assignments are tracked in another. Each vehicle has a unique license plate number that appears in both the vehicle inventory spreadsheet and the rental tracking spreadsheet, allowing the academy to connect vehicle details with their usage history. Claire, a new database administrator, is learning about data relationships and needs to understand how different pieces of information connect across the academy's data systems.
