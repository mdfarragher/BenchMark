title: "Evaluate Stream Processing For Weekly Gas Consumption Measurement"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Yes"
      explain: "Stream processing is designed for real-time or near-real-time data analysis as data flows through the system. Weekly gas consumption measurement involves analyzing accumulated data over a full week period, making it better suited for batch processing rather than stream processing."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "No"
      correct: true
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Only for real-time monitoring"
      explain: "While stream processing is indeed used for real-time monitoring, measuring weekly gas consumption requires analyzing data collected over an entire week, which is fundamentally a batch processing workload regardless of whether real-time monitoring is involved."

      title: "Only with sufficient data volume"
      explain: "The choice between stream and batch processing is not primarily determined by data volume but by the temporal nature of the processing requirements. Weekly consumption analysis needs to process complete weekly datasets, making it a batch processing scenario regardless of volume."

MDFT Academy operates multiple training facilities across different locations and needs to monitor energy consumption for cost optimization and environmental sustainability reporting. The academy's facilities management team collects utility usage data from various meters throughout their campuses to track energy efficiency trends and identify opportunities for cost savings.

Mark, the facilities manager at MDFT Academy, is implementing a data processing solution to analyze energy consumption patterns across all training centers. The academy needs to generate weekly reports showing total gas consumption for each facility to track usage trends, compare efficiency between locations, and prepare monthly budget reports. Claire, the data processing consultant, needs to recommend the appropriate data processing approach for generating these weekly consumption summaries from the accumulated daily meter readings.
