MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency, is migrating their on-premises infrastructure to Azure as part of their digital transformation initiative. Currently, the academy uses a shared network folder on their local file server to store course materials, student assignments, trainer resources, and administrative documents that need to be accessible to both instructors and students across multiple locations.

Mark, the IT infrastructure manager at MDFT Academy, is responsible for migrating this shared storage to Azure while maintaining the same functionality and accessibility. Claire, the operations director, wants to ensure that trainers and students can continue to access shared resources seamlessly using familiar file system operations without requiring significant changes to their existing workflows.

Which type of Azure storage should Mark use to replace the shared network folder while maintaining SMB protocol compatibility?
