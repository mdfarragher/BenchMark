MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency, operates multiple data integration workflows to support their comprehensive training programs. The academy needs to process student enrollment data from their CRM system, synchronize course completion records with their certification tracking database, extract learning analytics from their LMS platform, and integrate financial data from their billing system.
