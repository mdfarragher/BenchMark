MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency, operates a fleet of vehicles used for their mobile training programs and student transportation services. The academy maintains a detailed spreadsheet inventory system that tracks important information about each vehicle in their fleet, including license plate numbers, vehicle make, model, color, and the year each vehicle was purchased.

Mark, the fleet operations manager at MDFT Academy, uses this spreadsheet to manage vehicle maintenance schedules, insurance renewals, and replacement planning. Claire, the data analyst, has been asked to evaluate the data structure to determine the best approach for migrating this vehicle tracking system to a cloud-based database solution.

Evaluate the following statement: "MDFT Academy's vehicle fleet data is semi-structured." Is this statement correct?
