MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency, has been using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) packages for several years to manage their data integration workflows. These packages handle critical operations including importing student enrollment data, synchronizing course completion records, extracting training metrics from various systems, and generating monthly reporting data feeds.

Mark, the data migration specialist at MDFT Academy, is planning to move their data integration processes to Azure as part of their cloud transformation initiative. Claire, the database administrator, is concerned about maintaining their existing SSIS investments and wants to know if they can continue using their current SSIS packages in Azure Data Factory rather than rebuilding all workflows from scratch.

Evaluate the following statement: "Azure Data Factory can run SQL Server Integration Service (SSIS) packages using the Execute SSIS Package activity." Is this statement true?
