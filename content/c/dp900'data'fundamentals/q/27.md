MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency, has developed comprehensive Power BI reports to track student performance, course completion rates, instructor effectiveness, and training program outcomes. The academy serves diverse stakeholders including trainers, administrators, regional managers, and executives who need to analyze this data from different perspectives.

Mark, the business intelligence developer at MDFT Academy, wants to make the reports more accessible to non-technical users who may not be familiar with traditional data visualization interactions. Claire, the training operations director, specifically requested a way for report viewers to ask questions about the data using everyday language rather than having to understand complex chart configurations.

Which type of Power BI visual should Mark select to allow report viewers to ask questions about the data using natural language?
