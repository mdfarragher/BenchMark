MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency, operates both real-time and batch data processing workloads to support their comprehensive training analytics platform. The academy needs to process real-time student interaction data from their learning management system, streaming assessment results during live certification exams, and also handle large-scale batch processing of historical training data for monthly reports and trend analysis.

Mark, the data engineering lead at MDFT Academy, is evaluating Azure Databricks to consolidate their data processing infrastructure. Claire, the technical architect, wants to confirm that their chosen platform can handle both their immediate real-time analytics needs and their traditional batch processing requirements without requiring separate solutions.

Evaluate the following statement: "Azure Databricks can handle batch processing only." Is this statement correct?
