title: "Identify The Data Type Of JSON Format Data"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Structured"
      explain: "Structured data follows a rigid schema with predefined tables, columns, and relationships, typically found in relational databases. JSON data doesn't conform to this strict tabular format."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Relational"
      explain: "Relational data is stored in normalized tables with defined relationships between entities. JSON documents don't require the normalized table structure that characterizes relational data."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Semi-structured"
      correct: true
      explain: "Semi-structured data has some organizational properties but doesn't conform to rigid table structures. JSON data has labeled fields and hierarchical organization, making it semi-structured rather than completely structured or unstructured."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Unstructured"
      explain: "Unstructured data lacks any organizational schema, such as video, audio, or image files. JSON data has an identifiable structure with labeled fields and values, making it semi-structured."

Mark works as a data architect at MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that specializes in Microsoft Azure certifications. The academy stores student progress data, course information, and assessment results in various formats to support their comprehensive training programs.

Claire, the lead developer at MDFT Pro, needs to categorize different types of data files used in their student management system. She's specifically examining JSON files that contain student profiles with flexible fields like contact information, course preferences, and learning history. 

Claire wants to know what type of data the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format represents. What do you tell her?
