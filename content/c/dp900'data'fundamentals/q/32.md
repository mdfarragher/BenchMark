answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Yes, this is an ETL process"
      correct: true
      explain: "This is correct. The pipeline performs Extract (ingesting employee data from HR systems), Transform (adding latitude and longitude coordinates), and Load (storing enriched data in data warehouse), which are the three core components of ETL."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "No, this is only a data loading process"
      explain: "This is incorrect. The described process includes extracting employee data, transforming it by adding geocoding information, and loading it into a data warehouse, which constitutes all three ETL phases."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "No, this is an ELT process, not ETL"
      explain: "This is incorrect. The transformation (adding coordinates) occurs before loading into the data warehouse, making this an ETL process where Transform happens before Load."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "No, this is only data integration without transformation"
      explain: "This is incorrect. The process includes transformation by adding latitude and longitude coordinates to the employee records, which is a clear data transformation step."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, maintains comprehensive employee records to support their educational operations. The academy has implemented an Azure Data Factory pipeline that processes their employee data before storing it in their analytics data warehouse.

Mark, the data architect at MDFT Pro, has designed a pipeline that ingests employee data from various HR systems, enhances each record by adding latitude and longitude coordinates based on employee addresses, and then loads the enriched data into their central data warehouse. Claire, a new data analyst, needs to understand whether this pipeline represents an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process for her upcoming certification exam.

Does the described Azure Data Factory pipeline constitute an ETL process?
