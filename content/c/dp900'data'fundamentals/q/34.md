MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency, has developed an online learning platform that includes proctored certification exams. The academy has implemented an anti-cheating system that continuously monitors student behavior during online exams to ensure academic integrity.

Mark, the platform architect at MDFT Academy, needs to design a data processing solution that can handle the continuous stream of monitoring data generated by their anti-cheating system. Claire, the exam security coordinator, requires real-time analysis of this data to immediately detect and respond to suspicious activities during exam sessions. The solution must process data as it arrives without delays to maintain exam security.
