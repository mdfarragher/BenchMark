title: "Semi-Structured Data Schema Requirements"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Yes, all records must follow the same fixed schema"
      explain: "This is incorrect. Semi-structured data is specifically designed to be flexible and does not require adherence to a fixed schema, unlike structured data which requires all records to have the same attributes in the same order."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "No, records can have varying schemas and flexible structures"
      correct: true
      explain: "This is correct. Semi-structured data allows for flexibility in data organization, enabling records to have different fields, varying numbers of attributes, and nested structures without requiring a fixed schema."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Yes, but only the key fields must be consistent"
      explain: "This is incorrect. Semi-structured data does not require any fields to be consistent across all records. Each record can have completely different attributes and structures."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "No, but all records must have at least one common field"
      explain: "This is incorrect. Semi-structured data does not require any common fields between records. Each record can be completely independent in terms of its structure and attributes."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, is modernizing their student information system to better accommodate the diverse data they collect about their learners. The academy needs to store varied information about students, including different contact methods, certifications, and learning preferences that don't follow a consistent pattern.

Mark, the database architect at MDFT Pro, is explaining to Claire, a new systems analyst, the differences between data structure types. Claire is studying for her DP-900 certification and needs to understand the schema requirements for semi-structured data formats like JSON and XML that the academy plans to use for storing flexible student information.

Do semi-structured data formats require all records to adhere to a fixed schema?
