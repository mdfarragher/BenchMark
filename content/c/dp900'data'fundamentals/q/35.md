MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency, is modernizing their student information system to better accommodate the diverse data they collect about their learners. The academy needs to store varied information about students, including different contact methods, certifications, and learning preferences that don't follow a consistent pattern.

Mark, the database architect at MDFT Academy, is explaining to Claire, a new systems analyst, the differences between data structure types. Claire is studying for her DP-900 certification and needs to understand whether semi-structured data formats require all records to follow the same fixed schema, or if they allow for more flexibility in how data is organized and stored.
