MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency, has implemented several Azure Data Factory pipelines to process student enrollment data, course completion records, and assessment results. The academy needs to optimize their data processing workflows to handle peak enrollment periods efficiently.

Mark, the data integration architect at MDFT Academy, is designing a complex pipeline that needs to process multiple data sources simultaneously. Claire, a junior data engineer, is asking whether all activities within a single Azure Data Factory pipeline must execute in a sequential order, or if some activities can run in parallel to improve processing speed and efficiency for their student data workflows.
