MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency, has developed a comprehensive employee management system that processes staff information for their global operations. The academy uses Azure Data Factory to manage employee data integration from various HR systems into their central data warehouse.

Mark, the data architect at MDFT Academy, has implemented a pipeline that extracts employee records from multiple source systems, enhances each record by adding geographic coordinates based on employee addresses, and then loads the enriched data into their analytics warehouse. Claire, a business analyst studying data processes, wants to understand whether this pipeline represents an ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) process where transformation happens after loading data into the target system.
