      title: "Yes, this is an ELT process"
      explain: "This is incorrect. Since the geocoding transformation is applied before the data reaches the target warehouse, this represents ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), not ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "No, this is an ETL process"
      correct: true
      explain: "This is correct. The pipeline follows ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pattern because the transformation (adding geographic coordinates) occurs before loading the data into the warehouse. In ELT, data would be loaded first and then transformed within the target system."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Yes, because data is loaded into a warehouse"
      explain: "This is incorrect. The fact that data is loaded into a warehouse does not determine whether it's ELT. The key difference is when transformation occurs - before loading (ETL) or after loading (ELT)."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "No, this is neither ETL nor ELT"
      explain: "This is incorrect. The described process clearly follows the ETL pattern: extracting from sources, transforming (adding coordinates), and then loading into the warehouse."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, has developed a comprehensive employee management system that processes staff information for their global operations. The academy uses Azure Data Factory to manage employee data integration from various HR systems into their central data warehouse.

Mark, the data architect at MDFT Pro, has implemented a pipeline that extracts employee records from multiple source systems, enhances each record by adding geographic coordinates based on employee addresses, and then loads the enriched data into their analytics warehouse. Claire, a business analyst studying data processes, wants to understand whether this pipeline represents an ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) process where transformation happens after loading data into the target system.

Does the described pipeline represent an ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) process?
