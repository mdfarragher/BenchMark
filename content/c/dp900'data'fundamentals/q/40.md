MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency, processes massive amounts of student data including course completions, assessment scores, and learning analytics. The academy needs to design an efficient data processing strategy that can handle large volumes of data without impacting their day-to-day learning management system operations.

Mark, the data operations manager at MDFT Academy, is planning nightly processing jobs to analyze student performance data and generate comprehensive reports for instructors and administrators. Claire, a data engineer on his team, wants to understand whether batch processing is suitable for handling large datasets all at once, particularly for their monthly comprehensive analytics that process millions of student interaction records during off-peak hours.
