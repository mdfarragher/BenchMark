answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Yes, batch processing excels at handling large data sets"
      correct: true
      explain: "This is correct. Batch processing is specifically designed to handle large datasets at once, typically scheduled during off-peak hours to process massive volumes of data efficiently without real-time constraints."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "No, batch processing only handles small data chunks"
      explain: "This is incorrect. Batch processing is specifically designed to handle large datasets at once, typically scheduled during off-peak hours to minimize system impact."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Yes, but only during business hours"
      explain: "This is incorrect. Batch processing typically runs during off-peak hours (like nights or weekends) to avoid impacting operational systems, not during business hours."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "No, batch processing requires real-time data streams"
      explain: "This is incorrect. Batch processing works with static datasets that are processed at scheduled intervals, not real-time data streams which require stream processing."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, processes massive amounts of student data including course completions, assessment scores, and learning analytics. The academy needs to design an efficient data processing strategy that can handle large volumes of data without impacting their day-to-day learning management system operations.

Mark, the data operations manager at MDFT Pro, is planning nightly processing jobs to analyze student performance data and generate comprehensive reports for instructors and administrators. Claire, a data engineer on his team, wants to understand whether batch processing is suitable for handling large datasets all at once, particularly for their monthly comprehensive analytics that process millions of student interaction records during off-peak hours.

Can batch processing effectively load and process large data sets at once?
