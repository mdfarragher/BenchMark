MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency, stores sensitive course materials, student records, and assessment data in Azure Storage. The academy needs to implement granular security controls to ensure that different departments and roles can only access specific folders and directories within their storage containers.

Mark, the security architect at MDFT Academy, is tasked with implementing a security model where trainers can access course materials in their subject-specific folders, while administrators have broader access, and students can only access their individual assignment directories. Claire, the storage administrator, needs to understand what Azure Storage feature must be enabled to support this folder and directory-level access control requirement.
