MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency, operates a comprehensive employee management system that processes staff information from their global offices. The academy has implemented an Azure Data Factory pipeline that enhances employee records with geographic information for location-based analytics and reporting.

Mark, the data engineering manager at MDFT Academy, has designed a pipeline that ingests employee data from various HR systems, processes each record to add latitude and longitude coordinates based on their work locations, and then stores the enhanced data in their central data warehouse. Claire, a new team member studying data processing concepts, wants to understand whether the geocoding operation that adds geographic coordinates to each employee record constitutes a pipeline activity within the Azure Data Factory framework.
