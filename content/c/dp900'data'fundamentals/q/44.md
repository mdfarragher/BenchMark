MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency, is developing comprehensive Power BI dashboards to monitor student performance across their various certification courses. The academy wants to create interactive reports that allow instructors and administrators to view detailed student data while also displaying key summary information about selected students.

Mark, the business intelligence analyst at MDFT Academy, is designing a report that displays a list of students with their course enrollment details, grades, and progress information.
