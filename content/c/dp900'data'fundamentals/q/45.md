MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency, uses Azure Files to store course materials, training resources, and documentation that their distributed team of trainers and staff access regularly. The academy has noticed performance issues when on-premises users access files directly from Azure Files due to network latency and bandwidth constraints.

Mark, the IT operations manager at MDFT Academy, needs to improve file access performance for users in their on-premises offices while maintaining the central storage of files in Azure. Claire, the systems administrator, is looking for a solution that can automatically synchronize Azure Files content with local servers to create a performance-optimized hybrid file storage solution that provides fast local access with cloud-based backup and collaboration capabilities.
