You work as a data architect for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that provides Microsoft certification courses. The company collects various types of data from their learning management system, including structured student records in relational format and unstructured course feedback in JSON format. Mark, the IT director, has asked you to recommend a solution that can store both types of data cost-effectively.
