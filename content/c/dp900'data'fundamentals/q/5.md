MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency, currently operates an on-premises MariaDB server to track comprehensive information about their students' certification progress over time. The database stores temporal data that allows trainers to analyze student performance trends, compare course completion rates across different time periods, and generate predictive insights for course recommendations.
