      title: "Azure Table storage only"
      explain: "Azure Table Storage only supports read replicas in secondary regions through Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS). While you can have readable replicas in multiple regions, you cannot write data directly to secondary regions."

      title: "Cosmos DB Table API only"
      correct: true
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Cosmos DB Table API and Azure Table storage"
      explain: "While both services support read replicas, only Cosmos DB Table API supports multi-region writes. Azure Table Storage only provides read access to secondary regions, not write capabilities."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Neither service supports multi-region writes"
      explain: "Cosmos DB Table API specifically supports multi-region writes as one of its key features. You can configure multiple regions for both read and write operations, enabling global distribution of your application."

You work as a database architect for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that provides Microsoft certification courses globally. The company operates training centers in multiple regions worldwide and needs to implement a globally distributed student management system. Mark, the global operations director, has asked you to identify which non-relational data storage options support writing data in multiple geographic regions.

Claire, the infrastructure team lead, needs to understand which services can handle simultaneous write operations across different continents to ensure that student enrollments, course completions, and certification records can be updated locally in each region without conflicts or performance issues.

Which non-relational data stores support multi-region writes?
