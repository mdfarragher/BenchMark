      title: "Azure Table storage only"
      explain: "While Azure Table Storage does support read replicas through Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS), it's not the only service that provides this capability. Cosmos DB Table API also supports read replicas in multiple regions."

      title: "Cosmos DB Table API only"
      explain: "Cosmos DB Table API does support read replicas and multi-region reads, but it's not the only service with this capability. Azure Table Storage also provides read replicas through geo-redundant storage options."

      title: "Neither service supports read replicas"
      explain: "Both services actually support read replicas. Azure Table Storage provides this through RA-GRS (Read-access geo-redundant storage), and Cosmos DB Table API supports multi-region read replicas as a core feature."

You work as a database architect for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that provides Microsoft certification courses across multiple geographic regions. The company wants to improve read performance for their student management application by implementing read replicas that can serve queries from users in different locations. Mark, the performance optimization team lead, has asked you to identify which non-relational data storage services support read replica functionality.

Claire, the database administrator, needs to understand which services can provide readable copies of data in secondary regions to reduce latency for students and trainers accessing course information, enrollment records, and certification status from various global locations.

Which non-relational data stores support read replicas?
