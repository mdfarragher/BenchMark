    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Yes"
      explain: "Semi-structured data is designed to be flexible and does not require a predefined rigid schema. Unlike relational databases, semi-structured data can accommodate varying field structures and data types within the same dataset."

      correct: true
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Only for JSON data"
      explain: "Semi-structured data formats including JSON, XML, and others do not require strict schemas. The flexibility to store varying structures is a defining characteristic of all semi-structured data types."

      title: "Only when stored in Azure Cosmos DB"
      explain: "The schema flexibility of semi-structured data is inherent to the data type itself, not dependent on where it's stored. Whether in Azure Cosmos DB or other storage solutions, semi-structured data maintains its flexible nature."

MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency, is designing a new student management system to handle diverse student profiles and course data. The academy serves students from different backgrounds with varying information requirements - some students have multiple contact methods and previous certifications, while others have minimal profile data.

Claire, the lead data architect at MDFT Academy, is evaluating different data storage approaches for their student profiles. Mark, the development team lead, suggests using semi-structured data to accommodate the varying student information requirements. They need to determine if semi-structured data requires defining a strict schema upfront. 

Evaluate the following statement: "You need to define a strict schema on semi-structured data." Is this correct?
