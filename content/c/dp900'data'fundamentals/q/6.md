      title: "Yes, it requires a rigid predefined schema"
      explain: "Semi-structured data is designed to be flexible and does not require a predefined rigid schema. Unlike relational databases, semi-structured data can accommodate varying field structures and data types within the same dataset."

      title: "No, it allows flexible schema structures"
      correct: true
      explain: "Semi-structured data allows flexible schema structures where different records can have varying sets of fields. This flexibility is a key characteristic that distinguishes semi-structured data from structured relational data."

      title: "Only JSON data requires strict schemas"
      explain: "Semi-structured data formats including JSON, XML, and others do not require strict schemas. The flexibility to store varying structures is a defining characteristic of all semi-structured data types."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Schema requirements depend on the storage platform"
      explain: "The schema flexibility of semi-structured data is inherent to the data type itself, not dependent on where it's stored. Whether in Azure Cosmos DB or other storage solutions, semi-structured data maintains its flexible nature."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, is developing a comprehensive student management system. The development team is discussing different data storage approaches for student profiles, course progress, and assessment results. The data they need to store varies significantly between students - some have extensive certification histories, while others are just beginning their learning journey.

Mark, a data architect at MDFT Pro, is explaining data types to the development team. Claire, a junior developer, asks about semi-structured data and whether it requires the same rigid schema constraints as traditional relational databases used for course catalogs and enrollment records.

Does semi-structured data require a strict schema like structured relational data?
