You work as a human resources systems analyst for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that provides Microsoft certification courses. The company employs hundreds of trainers, administrative staff, and support personnel across multiple locations. Each month, the HR department needs to calculate payroll based on employee timesheets, overtime hours, benefits deductions, and tax withholdings. Mark, the HR operations director, has asked you to recommend the most appropriate data processing approach for handling the company's monthly payroll calculations.

Claire, the payroll team supervisor, needs to understand whether batch processing would be suitable for collecting all employee time data, calculating wages, processing deductions, and generating paychecks and tax reports in a scheduled monthly operation that processes data accumulated over the entire billing period.
