title: "Determine If Azure Cosmos DB Reduces Data Duplication Through Normalization"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Yes"
      explain: "Azure Cosmos DB does not reduce data duplication through normalization. As a NoSQL database, it supports denormalization, which actually increases data duplication but simplifies queries and schema structure."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "No"
      correct: true
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Only in certain configurations"
      explain: "Azure Cosmos DB consistently supports denormalization across all its APIs and configurations, which increases rather than reduces data duplication."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Only with SQL API"
      explain: "All Azure Cosmos DB APIs support denormalization regardless of which API is used (Core SQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Gremlin, or Table)."

You work as a data modeler at MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency that provides Microsoft certification courses. The academy is migrating from a traditional relational database system to Azure Cosmos DB and needs to understand how data modeling principles differ between the two approaches.

Mark, the database administrator, is familiar with relational database normalization techniques that reduce data duplication by creating reference tables and maintaining data integrity through foreign keys. Claire, the cloud architect, wants to understand whether Azure Cosmos DB follows the same normalization principles or uses a different approach to manage data duplication and structure.
