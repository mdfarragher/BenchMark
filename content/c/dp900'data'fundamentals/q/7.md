MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency, generates massive amounts of data from their global Azure certification training programs. This includes video recordings of training sessions, student assignment submissions, assessment results, course materials, and detailed learning analytics from thousands of students across multiple geographic regions.

Mark, the cloud infrastructure manager at MDFT Academy, needs to find a cost-effective solution to store and manage this growing data repository, which is expected to reach hundreds of terabytes. Claire, the financial controller, is particularly concerned about storage costs and wants to ensure they only pay for what they actually use while maintaining the ability to archive older, less frequently accessed training materials. 

Evaluate the following statement: "Azure Data Lake Storage is capable of storing a large amount of data in a cost-effective way." Is this statement true?
