type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Azure Cosmos DB"
      correct: true
      explain: "Azure Cosmos DB is ideal for sensor data storage because of its ability to handle high-frequency data ingestion, provide extremely low latency access, scale globally, and support real-time analytics - all essential requirements for IoT sensor applications."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Azure SQL Database"
      explain: "Azure SQL Database, while reliable, may not provide the extremely low latency and high scalability required for ingesting vast amounts of sensor data from IoT devices in real-time."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Azure Table Storage"
      explain: "Azure Table Storage is suitable for simple key-value scenarios but lacks the advanced querying, global distribution, and low-latency capabilities needed for complex sensor data analytics."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Azure Blob Storage"
      explain: "Azure Blob Storage is designed for storing large files and unstructured data but is not optimized for the high-frequency, low-latency data ingestion typical of sensor arrays."

You work as an IoT solutions architect at MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that provides Microsoft certification courses. The academy is expanding their facilities and wants to implement a smart building system that monitors environmental conditions, energy usage, and space utilization across their multiple campuses.

Mark, the facilities manager, explains that they need to collect data from hundreds of sensors measuring temperature, humidity, occupancy, lighting levels, and energy consumption in real-time. Claire, the data architect, must select a database solution that can efficiently handle the continuous, high-volume ingestion of sensor data while maintaining low latency for real-time monitoring and analytics.

Which database service is most appropriate for storing sensor data?
