MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency, operates a complex data ecosystem to support their Azure certification training programs. They store student data in Azure Cosmos DB, training videos and course materials in Azure Blob Storage, detailed analytics in Azure Data Lake Storage, and historical reporting data in Azure Synapse Analytics.

Claire, the data integration specialist at MDFT Academy, needs to create automated data pipelines to consolidate information from these various sources into a unified reporting system. Mark, the cloud solutions architect, wants to verify that Azure Data Factory can handle all their current data sources before proceeding with implementation. 

Evaluate the following statement: "Azure Data Factory can load data from Azure Blob Storage, Azure Data Lake Storage, Azure Cosmos DB, and Azure Synapse Analytics." Is this statement true?
