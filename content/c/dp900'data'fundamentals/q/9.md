MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency, stores a variety of digital assets to support their Azure certification programs. They have frequently accessed course materials and student resources that need immediate availability, training videos that are accessed weekly during course delivery, and archived certification materials that are rarely accessed but must be retained for compliance purposes.

Mark, the storage administrator at MDFT Academy, wants to optimize storage costs by implementing a tiered storage strategy. Claire, the financial manager, has requested a solution that can automatically move data between different cost tiers based on access patterns to minimize storage expenses while maintaining appropriate availability. 

Which Azure storage service includes support for Hot, Cool, and Archive access tiers?
