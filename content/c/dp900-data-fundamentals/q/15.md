MDFT Pro's data science team processes vast amounts of educational data using various analytics frameworks including Apache Spark and Hadoop-based tools for machine learning and predictive analytics on student performance. The team has existing Hadoop workflows that were developed to analyze learning patterns and optimize course recommendations.

Claire, the technical director at MDFT Pro, is planning to migrate their big data analytics infrastructure to Azure while maintaining compatibility with their existing Hadoop-based data processing pipelines. Mark, the data engineer, needs to ensure that their current HDFS-based applications can seamlessly work with Azure storage services.

Does Azure Data Lake Storage provide hierarchical namespace compatibility with Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)?
