      title: "Archive"
      explain: "The Archive tier is designed for data that is rarely accessed and can tolerate several hours of rehydration time before becoming available. Since the reports need to be available as soon as possible, this tier would not meet the immediate accessibility requirement."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Hot"
      explain: "The Hot tier is optimized for frequently accessed data and provides the fastest access times, but it has high storage costs. Since this data is only accessed occasionally, the Hot tier would be unnecessarily expensive for this use case."

      title: "Cool"
      correct: true
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Premium"
      explain: "The Premium tier offers the highest performance with low latency and high throughput, but it's the most expensive option and is typically used for workloads requiring consistent high performance, not for occasionally accessed archival data."

MDFT Pro has accumulated several years of historical student assessment data, course evaluation surveys, and training material usage statistics. This older data is not frequently accessed but occasionally needs to be retrieved to generate comparative analysis reports for accreditation reviews and long-term trend analysis that must be available quickly when requested.

Mark, the data storage administrator at MDFT Pro, needs to optimize storage costs for this archival educational data while ensuring it remains accessible for periodic reporting needs. Claire, the financial controller, has requested a cost-effective storage solution that balances reduced storage expenses with the requirement that data can be retrieved immediately when needed for compliance reports or academic research purposes.

Which Azure Blob Storage access tier should Mark recommend for this archival data?
