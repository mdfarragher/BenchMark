    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Stream processing"
      correct: false
      explain: "Stream processing is designed for real-time or near-real-time data analysis as data flows through the system. Weekly gas consumption measurement involves analyzing accumulated data over a full week period, making it better suited for batch processing rather than stream processing."

      title: "Batch processing"
      correct: true
      explain: "Batch processing is the appropriate choice for weekly gas consumption analysis because it processes complete datasets collected over defined time periods (weekly intervals) rather than continuous data streams. This allows for comprehensive analysis of all consumption data for each complete week."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Real-time processing only"
      explain: "While real-time monitoring might be used for immediate alerts, measuring weekly gas consumption requires analyzing data collected over an entire week, which is fundamentally a batch processing workload regardless of whether real-time monitoring is involved."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Hybrid processing"
      explain: "Although hybrid approaches exist, weekly consumption analysis specifically requires processing complete weekly datasets, making batch processing the primary and most appropriate method for this particular requirement."

MDFT Pro operates multiple training facilities across different locations and needs to monitor energy consumption for cost optimization and environmental sustainability reporting. The academy's facilities management team collects utility usage data from various meters throughout their campuses to track energy efficiency trends and identify opportunities for cost savings.

Mark, the facilities manager at MDFT Pro, is implementing a data processing solution to analyze energy consumption patterns across all training centers. The academy needs to generate weekly reports showing total gas consumption for each facility to track usage trends, compare efficiency between locations, and prepare monthly budget reports. Claire, the data processing consultant, needs to recommend the appropriate data processing approach for generating these weekly consumption summaries from the accumulated daily meter readings.

Which data processing method should Claire recommend for analyzing weekly gas consumption patterns?
