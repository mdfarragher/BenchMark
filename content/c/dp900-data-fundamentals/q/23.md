MDFT Pro operates multiple data integration workflows to support their comprehensive training programs. The academy needs to process student enrollment data from their CRM system, synchronize course completion records with their certification tracking database, extract learning analytics from their LMS platform, and integrate financial data from their billing system.

Mark, the data integration architect at MDFT Pro, is designing an Azure Data Factory solution to handle these diverse data workflows. Claire, the data governance manager, wants to understand if they can organize different types of data integration processes within a single Azure Data Factory instance to maintain better oversight and cost management.

Can Azure Data Factory support multiple pipelines within a single data factory instance?
