MDFT Pro is designing a comprehensive data architecture to support their expanding Azure certification programs. MDFT Pro needs to store various types of data including highly structured student enrollment records, course schedules, instructor information, and certification tracking data that all follow consistent schemas and require strong data integrity guarantees.

Mark, the database architect at MDFT Pro, needs to select the most appropriate database technology for their structured data requirements. Claire, the lead developer, wants to ensure they choose a solution that supports ACID transactions, SQL queries, and maintains referential integrity across their interconnected student, course, and instructor data.

Which type of database should Mark recommend for storing structured data with consistent schemas and strong relational integrity?
