MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, has recently migrated their student data processing workflows to Azure. The academy uses Azure Data Factory to orchestrate various data integration tasks across their learning management system.

Mark, the lead data engineer at MDFT Pro, is explaining to Claire, a new team member, how Azure Data Factory pipelines work. Claire wants to understand whether a single pipeline can contain multiple activities or if each activity requires its own separate pipeline.

Can a single Azure Data Factory pipeline contain multiple activities?
