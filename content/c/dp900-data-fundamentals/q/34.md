answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Online Transaction Processing (OLTP)"
      explain: "OLTP is designed for transactional systems that handle day-to-day operations requiring strong consistency, not for processing continuous data streams in real-time."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Stream Processing"
      correct: true
      explain: "This is correct. Stream processing is specifically designed to handle continuous data streams in real-time, processing data as it arrives. It's ideal for scenarios requiring immediate analysis and response to incoming data flows."

      title: "Online Analytical Processing (OLAP)"
      explain: "OLAP is designed for complex analysis and reporting on historical data, not for handling real-time continuous data streams that require immediate processing."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Batch Processing"
      explain: "Batch processing handles data in scheduled intervals or when certain data volumes are reached, which introduces delays and is not suitable for real-time requirements."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, has developed an online learning platform that includes proctored certification exams. The academy has implemented an anti-cheating system that continuously monitors student behavior during online exams to ensure academic integrity.

Mark, the platform architect at MDFT Pro, needs to design a data processing solution that can handle the continuous stream of monitoring data generated by their anti-cheating system. Claire, the exam security coordinator, requires real-time analysis of this data to immediately detect and respond to suspicious activities during exam sessions. The solution must process data as it arrives without delays to maintain exam security.

Which type of data workload is most appropriate for processing the continuous stream of monitoring data in real-time?
