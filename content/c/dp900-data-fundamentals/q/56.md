    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Yes"
      correct: true
      explain: "Stream processing is specifically designed to handle data at the moment it is generated, providing real-time processing capabilities with minimal latency. This enables immediate analysis and response to events as they occur, making it ideal for scenarios requiring instant feedback and real-time decision making."

      title: "No"
      explain: "Stream processing is specifically designed to process data as it's generated, with minimal latency. This real-time processing capability is one of the key advantages of stream processing over batch processing."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Only with batch processing"
      explain: "Batch processing works with collected data over time periods, not data at the moment it's generated. Stream processing is the technology designed for processing data as it's created in real-time."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Only for small data volumes"
      explain: "Stream processing can handle both small and large volumes of data as it's generated. The key characteristic is the real-time processing capability, not the volume of data being processed."

You work as a real-time analytics engineer for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that provides Microsoft certification courses through online platforms. The company wants to implement real-time monitoring of student engagement during live virtual classrooms to automatically adjust content delivery and provide immediate feedback. Mark, the educational technology director, has asked you to explain the capabilities of stream processing for handling data as it's created.

Claire, the platform development team lead, needs to understand whether stream processing can handle data from student interactions, quiz responses, and participation metrics at the exact moment these events occur, enabling immediate responses such as personalized recommendations or real-time assistance.

Can you process stream data at the moment it is generated?
