You work as a data engineer at MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that provides Microsoft certification courses. The academy processes large amounts of student performance data, course completion statistics, and assessment results to improve their training programs.

Mark, the head of data analytics, wants to implement Apache Spark for processing this data efficiently. Claire, the cloud architect, has asked you to identify which Azure services are compatible with Apache Spark and can be used to provision the necessary infrastructure for their data processing tasks.
