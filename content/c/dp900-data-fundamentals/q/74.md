answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Cassandra API"
      explain: "The Cassandra API uses SQL-like syntax similar to the Core API, not the graph-oriented syntax shown in the query."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "MongoDB API"
      explain: "The MongoDB API uses object-oriented syntax with commands like db.collection.find(), not graph traversal syntax."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Core API"
      explain: "The Core (SQL) API uses standard SQL syntax with keywords like SELECT, FROM, and WHERE, not graph traversal functions."

      title: "Gremlin API"
      correct: true
      explain: "The Gremlin API uses graph traversal syntax with functions like g.V(), hasLabel(), and order(), making it the API that matches this query syntax for graph database operations."

You work as a database consultant at MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that provides Microsoft certification courses. The academy is implementing a social learning platform that tracks relationships between students, instructors, courses, and study groups using Azure Cosmos DB.

Mark, a database administrator, has found a query in their codebase but is unfamiliar with its syntax. The query is:

```gremlin
g.V().hasLabel('person').order().by('firstName', decr)
```

Claire, the development team lead, has asked you to identify which Azure Cosmos DB API this query belongs to, as this will help them understand the data model and ensure they have the right expertise on the team to maintain and extend this functionality.

Which Azure Cosmos DB API is used in this query?
