      correct: true
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Table Name"

MDFT Pro is designing a scalable data storage solution to manage their growing student database. MDFT Pro needs to store diverse student information including enrollment details, course progress, certification achievements, and contact information for thousands of students across multiple training programs and geographic locations.

Mark, the database architect at MDFT Pro, is evaluating Azure Table Storage as a cost-effective solution for storing this semi-structured student data. Claire, the lead developer, needs to understand how data is uniquely identified and retrieved in Azure Table Storage to properly design their data access patterns and ensure efficient queries.

Which two elements compose a key in Azure Table Storage that uniquely identify each entity?
