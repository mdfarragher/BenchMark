title: "Pipeline Activity Execution Patterns"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Yes, all activities must run sequentially"
      explain: "This is incorrect. Azure Data Factory pipelines support both sequential and parallel execution of activities, allowing for more efficient and flexible data processing workflows."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "No, activities can run in parallel and sequentially"
      correct: true
      explain: "This is correct. Azure Data Factory pipelines support both parallel and sequential execution patterns. Activities can run in parallel when there are no dependencies between them, and sequentially when one activity depends on the output of another."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Yes, but only within individual activity groups"
      explain: "This is incorrect. There are no specific activity groups that restrict execution patterns. Activities within a pipeline can be configured to run in parallel or sequentially based on their dependencies."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "No, but only certain activity types can run in parallel"
      explain: "This is incorrect. All activity types in Azure Data Factory can run in parallel as long as there are no dependencies between them. The execution pattern is determined by dependencies, not by activity type."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, has implemented several Azure Data Factory pipelines to process student enrollment data, course completion records, and assessment results. The academy needs to optimize their data processing workflows to handle peak enrollment periods efficiently.

Mark, the data integration architect at MDFT Pro, is designing a complex pipeline that needs to process multiple data sources simultaneously. Claire, a junior data engineer, is asking whether all activities within a single Azure Data Factory pipeline must execute in a sequential order, or if some activities can run in parallel to improve processing speed and efficiency for their student data workflows.

Can pipeline activities in Azure Data Factory only run sequentially, or can they also execute in parallel?
