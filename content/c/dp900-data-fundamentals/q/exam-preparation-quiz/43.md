title: "Data Transformation as Pipeline Activity"

      title: "Yes, it is a data transformation activity"
      correct: true
      explain: "This is correct. Geocoding employee records represents a data transformation operation, which is a core type of pipeline activity that processes and modifies data as it flows through the Azure Data Factory pipeline."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "No, it is only a data enrichment process"
      explain: "This is incorrect. Data enrichment (like geocoding) is a form of data transformation, which is indeed a pipeline activity that processes and modifies data as it flows through the pipeline."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Yes, but only if it changes the data structure"
      explain: "This is incorrect. Pipeline activities include all forms of data processing, including adding new fields without changing the overall structure, as in geocoding operations."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "No, it is a separate external process"
      explain: "This is incorrect. When implemented within an Azure Data Factory pipeline, geocoding becomes a pipeline activity regardless of whether it uses external services or internal transformation logic."

MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, operates a comprehensive employee management system that processes staff information from their global offices. The academy has implemented an Azure Data Factory pipeline that enhances employee records with geographic information for location-based analytics and reporting.

Mark, the data engineering manager at MDFT Pro, has designed a pipeline that ingests employee data from various HR systems, processes each record to add latitude and longitude coordinates based on their work locations, and then stores the enhanced data in their central data warehouse. Claire, a new team member studying data processing concepts, wants to understand whether the geocoding operation that adds geographic coordinates to each employee record constitutes a pipeline activity within the Azure Data Factory framework.

Is geocoding employee records considered a pipeline activity in Azure Data Factory?
