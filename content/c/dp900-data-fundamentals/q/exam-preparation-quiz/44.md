MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency, is developing comprehensive Power BI dashboards to monitor student performance across their various certification courses. The academy wants to create interactive reports that allow instructors and administrators to view detailed student data while also displaying key summary information about selected students.

Mark, the business intelligence analyst at MDFT Pro, is designing a report that displays a list of students with their course enrollment details, grades, and progress information. Claire, a course coordinator, needs the ability to select individual student rows and see additional headline information such as overall GPA, completion percentage, and certification status displayed prominently. The solution requires two complementary visual components that work together to provide both detailed and summary views.

Which two Power BI visuals should be used to display detailed row data alongside selection-based headline information?
