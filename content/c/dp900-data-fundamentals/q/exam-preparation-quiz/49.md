      title: "Container"
      correct: true
      explain: "Containers in Azure Blob Storage provide a logical grouping mechanism for organizing blobs. You can create separate containers for different file types (e.g., 'videos' and 'audio'), making it easy to manage access permissions, apply different policies, and organize content while maintaining them in the same storage account."

      title: "Blob"
      explain: "A blob is an individual file stored in Azure Blob Storage. Blobs are stored within containers, so creating separate blobs wouldn't help organize different file types - they would still be mixed together in the same container."

      title: "Storage account"
      explain: "A storage account provides the top-level namespace for Azure Storage services. Creating separate storage accounts for different file types would be unnecessarily complex and expensive, as storage accounts are meant to group related storage services together."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Archive tier"
      explain: "Archive tier is an access tier that determines the cost and retrieval speed of blobs, not their organization. It's used for rarely accessed data and doesn't help separate file types organizationally."

You work as a storage administrator for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that provides Microsoft certification courses. The company currently stores conference recordings as video files in Azure Blob Storage, and the marketing department now wants to add audio recordings of course lectures as well. Mark, the operations director, has asked you to recommend the best way to organize these different file types.

Claire, the content manager, needs to understand how to logically separate video and audio files so that the marketing team can easily locate and manage each type of content independently while maintaining them in the same storage account.

What should you recommend to organize the different file types?
