title: "Determine Whether To Use Stream Processing For Temperature Monitoring"
type: "question"
layout: "single"

    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Yes"
      correct: true
      explain: "Stream processing is ideal for temperature monitoring on production lines because it processes data continuously in real-time as it arrives from sensors. This enables immediate detection of temperature anomalies, triggering alerts or automated responses to prevent equipment damage and maintain safe operating conditions."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "No"
      explain: "Stream processing is specifically designed for continuous, real-time data monitoring scenarios like temperature sensors. Using batch processing instead would create dangerous delays in detecting temperature anomalies that require immediate attention."

      title: "Only during business hours"
      explain: "Temperature monitoring on a production line requires 24/7 continuous monitoring. Production equipment can experience temperature issues at any time, and limiting monitoring to business hours could result in equipment damage or safety hazards."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Only for critical equipment"
      explain: "All temperature sensors on a production line should be monitored continuously, not just critical equipment. Non-critical equipment failures can cascade and affect the entire production process, making comprehensive monitoring essential."

You work as an operations engineer for MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that operates a manufacturing facility for creating educational materials and equipment. The facility has multiple production lines equipped with temperature sensors that need constant monitoring to ensure optimal operating conditions and prevent equipment damage. Mark, the production manager, has asked you to recommend the appropriate data processing approach for this monitoring system.

Claire, the facility supervisor, needs to understand whether stream processing would be suitable for monitoring temperature sensors across all production lines, considering that temperature fluctuations can occur rapidly and require immediate response to prevent costly equipment failures or safety incidents.

Should you use stream processing to monitor temperature sensors on a production line?
