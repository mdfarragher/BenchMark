You work as a database architect at MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that provides Microsoft certification courses. The academy is planning to migrate their student management system to Azure Cosmos DB to handle the growing number of students and course data.

Mark, the lead developer, has asked you to identify which Azure Cosmos DB APIs support SQL syntax for querying data. This will help the development team choose the most appropriate API for their existing SQL-based reporting tools and ensure a smoother migration process.
