You work as a database architect at MDFT Pro, a well-known training agency that provides Microsoft certification courses. The academy is developing a social learning platform where students can connect with each other, form study groups, share resources, and interact with trainers.

Mark, the platform development lead, explains that the social network will need to store complex relationship data such as student connections, group memberships, course enrollments, and interaction histories that change frequently as new connections are made. Claire, the data architect, needs to select a database solution that can efficiently handle these complex, evolving relationship structures between students, trainers, and courses.
