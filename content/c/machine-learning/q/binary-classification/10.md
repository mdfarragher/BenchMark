      title: "It means the model predictions are heavily biased"
      explain: "Our calibration curve is a straight diagonal line which means the model predictions are not biased."

You have built a binary classification model to predict if a tree in a forest is sick or healthy. A prediction with an output value of 1.0 means that the model is 100% confident that a tree is healthy. 

You calculate the calibration curve of your tree prediction model. The curve is a straight line, indicating that the mean prediction is always identical to the observed fraction. 

What does this say about the model bias?
