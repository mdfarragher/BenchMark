You have built a binary classification model to predict if a tree in a forest is sick or healthy. A prediction with an output value of 1.0 means that the model is 100% confident that a tree is healthy. 

You run the model and it predicts that 40% of the trees in the forest are healthy. You decide to raise the threshold and run the model again. 

What will the model predict now?
