You have built a binary classification model to predict if a tree in a forest is sick or healthy. A prediction with an output value of 1.0 means that the model is 100% confident that a tree is healthy. 

You drive around the forest and notice only a few healthy trees, more than 99% of the forest is sick. You decide to use the accuracy metric to evaluate your tree prediction model. 

Is this the correct choice?
