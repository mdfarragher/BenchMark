type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: answer1
      title: "The recall goes up"
      explain: "Precision and recall are inversely correlated to the threshold. We can only make the recall go up by adjusting the threshold to lower the precision."

    - id: answer2
      title: "The recall stays the same"
      explain: "Precision and recall are inversely correlated to the threshold. They will always move in opposite directions when the threshold changes."

    - id: answer3
      title: "The recall goes down"
      correct: true

    - id: answer4
      title: "It's impossible to say"
      explain: "The behavior of precision and recall when the threshold changes is well known."

You have built a binary classification model to predict if a tree in a forest is sick or healthy. A prediction with an output value of 1.0 means that the model is 100% confident that a tree is healthy. 

Your tree prediction model has a precision of 0.4. You are not happy with this value and decide to raise it by changing the threshold.
