You have built a binary classification model to predict if a tree in a forest is sick or healthy. A prediction with an output value of 1.0 means that the model is 100% confident that a tree is healthy. 

The forest contains mostly sick trees. Sending a crew out to tend to a sick tree is very expensive, so you want to avoid false negatives as much as possible. 

Which metric or combination of metrics should you use to evaluate the model?
