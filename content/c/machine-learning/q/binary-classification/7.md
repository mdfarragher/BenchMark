      title: "Based on the given information, it's impossible to say"
      explain: "The correct answer is clear, because the ROC curve is calculated from  all possible threshold values."

You have built a binary classification model to predict if a tree in a forest is sick or healthy. A prediction with an output value of 1.0 means that the model is 100% confident that a tree is healthy. 

You calculate the ROC curve of your tree prediction model. You're not happy with the shape of the curve so you decide to raise the threshold.
