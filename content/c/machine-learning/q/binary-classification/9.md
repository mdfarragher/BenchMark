You have built a binary classification model to predict if a tree in a forest is sick or healthy. A prediction with an output value of 1.0 means that the model is 100% confident that a tree is healthy. 

The forest service decides to use a robot to tend to sick trees. The robot is cheap and fast, so now you no longer care about false negatives. 

Which metric or combination of metrics should you use now to evaluate the model?
