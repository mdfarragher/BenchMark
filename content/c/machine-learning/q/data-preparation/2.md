      title: "There is no risk. You can import this column without any preprocessing"
      explain: "The prices are the largest numbers in the dataset, and may become the focus of some machine learning algorithms that prioritize large numbers."

    - id: answer2
      title: "The model will pay too much attention to the price column"
      correct: true

    - id: answer3
      title: "The model will not pay enough attention to the price column"
      explain: "The prices are the largest numbers in the dataset, and may become the focus of some machine learning algorithms that prioritize large numbers."

      title: "The model may not be trained correctly because it cannot process numerical data outside a range of 0 to 1"
      explain: "Machine learning algorithms can process numerical data on any range. However, data normalized around zero tends to work best."

You are preparing a dataset for machine learning training. The dataset only has numerical columns. All columns have values in a range from 0 to 1, except a single price column with values ranging from 0 to 1000. 

You decide to use this data for training without performing any numerical preprocessing. 

What is the risk of this approach?
