title: "How should you process the column?"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: answer1
      title: "You can load the values directly without further processing"
      explain: "This is not recommended, because some machine learning algorithms prioritize large numbers and might conclude that third class is more important than first class."

    - id: answer2
      title: "You should one-hot encode the column"
      correct: true

    - id: answer3
      title: "You should normalize the column"
      explain: "Data columns that represent categories should be one-hot encoded, not normalized."
      
    - id: answer4
      title: "You should clip all values above 2"
      explain: "This will assign all 3rd class passengers to 2nd class and fundamentally alter the dataset."

You are preparing a dataset for machine learning training. The dataset contains information on shipping cruises from a travel company. One of the columns is the class number of the passenger cabin, with values of 1, 2, or 3. 

How should you process this column?
