type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: answer1
      title: "Bin the latitude and longitude values"
      explain: "Binning produces bin numbers, which are categories that must be one-hot encoded."

    - id: answer2
      title: "One-hot encode the latitude and longitude values"
      explain: "Latitude and longitude are not categories, so they cannot be one-hot encoded."

    - id: answer3
      title: "Bin the latitude and longitude values, then one-hot encode the bin numbers"
      correct: true
      
    - id: answer4
      title: "Load the latitude and longitude values without further processing"
      explain: "This is not recommended, because some machine learning algorithms prioritize large numbers and might conclude that houses in the top-left corner of the state of California are more important than houses in the bottom-right corner."

You are creating an app that predicts the price of a house in California based on its exact location. Your app uses a machine learning model that will be trained on a dataset of houses in California. For each house, the dataset contains the price, the number of rooms, the year when the house was built, and the latitude and longitude. 

How should you process the latitude and longitude values?
