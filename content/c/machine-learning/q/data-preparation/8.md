You are creating an app that predicts the price of a house in California based on its exact location. Your app uses a machine learning model that will be trained on a dataset of houses in California. For each house, the dataset contains the price, the number of rooms, the year when the house was built, and the latitude and longitude. 

You decide to bin and then one-hot encode the year when the house was built. 

Is this a valid choice?
