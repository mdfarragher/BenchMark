      explain: "Some machine learning algorithms prioritize large numbers and might conclude that credit card payments are twice as important as cash payments."

You are preparing a dataset for machine learning training. The dataset contains a list of taxi trips in New York city. One of the data columns is called 'payment_type' and contains a 1 for cash payments or 2 for credit card payments. 

You decide to load this column directly without any data processing.

What are the risks of this approach?
