answers:
    - id: answer1
      title: "Set the validation type to auto"
      explain: "The validation type setting controls how datasets are validated in the Azure cloud. This will not help to implement the transparency principle."

    - id: answer2
      title: "Enable the setting Explain Best Model"
      correct: true

    - id: answer3
      title: "Set the primary metric to accuracy"
      explain: "Accuracy is a metric for evaluating classification models. Using the accuracy will not help to implement the transparency principle."

      title: "Set the max concurrent iterations to 0"
      explain: "This setting controls how many machine learning models can be trained in parallel in the cloud. This will not help to implement the transparency principle."

more: "The setting Explain Best Model in the Azure cloud created a so-called explainable machine learning model that can explain how it generates its predictions. This makes AI predictions fully transparent. Explainable machine learning models are the foundation of the principles of responsible AI."

You build and train a machine learning model. You need to ensure that the model meets the Microsoft transparency principle for responsible AI.
