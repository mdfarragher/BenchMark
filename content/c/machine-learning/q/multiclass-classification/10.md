You are building an app that can recognize handwriting. To train your model, you use a very large dataset with millions of handwritten letters. You notice that the dataset is biased.

You add more handwriting examples to the dataset and manage to balance the classes. Each class now appears equally often in the dataset. 

Which micro- and macro accuracy values will you get now?
