type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: answer1
      title: "By using a 1-versus-all configuration"
      explain: "In 1-versus-all, each binary classifier needs to compare one class against all other classes in the dataset. This will take a very long time if the binary classifiers are slow-learning."

      title: "By using a 1-versus-1 configuration"
      correct: true

    - id: answer3
      title: "By using an all-versus-all configuration"
      explain: "There is no all-versus-all configuration."

    - id: answer4
      title: "By using an all-versus-1 configuration"
      explain: "There is no all-versus-1 configuration."

You are building an app that can recognize handwriting. To train your model, you use a very large dataset with millions of handwritten examples. Your multiclass classifier is built up out of many slow-learning binary classification algorithms. 

How should you assemble your binary classifiers into a multiclass classification model?
