You are building an app that can recognize handwriting. To train your models, you use a very large dataset with millions of handwritten letters. 

You have prepared two models. The first model evaluates to a micro accuracy of 0.88 and the second model evaluates to a micro accuracy of 0.91. 

Which model produces better predictions?
