      title: "Zeroes on the main diagonal, nonzero numbers everywhere else"
      explain: "It would mean that every prediction the model makes is incorrect."

      title: "Nonzero numbers on the main diagonal, zeroes everywhere else"
      correct: true

    - id: answer3
      title: "Nonzero numbers in every position in the matrix"
      explain: "It would mean that the model makes correct and incorrect predictions."

    - id: answer4
      title: "Zeroes in every position in the matrix"
      explain: "It would mean that the model has not made any predictions at all."

You are building an app that can recognize handwriting. To train your model, you use a very large dataset with millions of handwritten letters. 

After lots of hyperparameter tweaking, your model is finally able to recognize each handwritten letter perfectly. 

What does the confusion matrix look like now?
