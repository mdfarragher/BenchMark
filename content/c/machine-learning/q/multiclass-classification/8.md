title: "What is causing the difference in accuracies?"
type: "question"
layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: answer1
      title: "The dataset is unbiased"
      explain: "A gap between micro- and macro accuracies means that the dataset is biased."
      
    - id: answer2
      title: "The dataset is biased, and the accuracy on the popular classes is much higher than the accuracy on the rare classes."
      explain: "For this to be true, the micro accuracy would have to be higher than the macro accuracy."

    - id: answer3
      title: "The dataset is biased, and the accuracy on the popular classes is the same as the accuracy on the rare classes."
      explain: "For this to be true, the micro accuracy would have to be roughly equal to the macro accuracy."

You are building an app that can recognize handwriting. To train your model, you use a very large dataset with millions of handwritten letters. 

You calculate the macro accuracy of your handwriting app and get a value of 0.7. Then you calculate the micro accuracy, but now you get a value of 0.1. 

What is causing this huge difference?
