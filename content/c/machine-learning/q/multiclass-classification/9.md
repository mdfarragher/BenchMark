You are building an app that can recognize handwriting. To train your model, you use a very large dataset with millions of handwritten letters. 

You calculate the macro accuracy of your handwriting app and get a value of 0.7. Then you calculate the micro accuracy, but now you get a value of 0.1. 

How should you fix this problem?
