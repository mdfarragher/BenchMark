      correct: true

      title: "The MSE has decreased"
      explain: "The formula for MSE = B*2+V. The MSE can only decrease if both bias and variance decrease, or if the variance decreases more than twice as fast as the bias increases."

    - id: answer3
      title: "The MSE has stayed the same"
      explain: "If the bias and variance change in opposite direction by the same amount, the MSE increases."
      
    - id: answer4
      title: "It's impossible to say based on the given data"
      explain: "The MSE depends directly on the bias and variance, so if we know both values, we can calculate how the MSE has changed."

You are building a regression model to predict the wind speed at any point on earth during any time of the day. 

You've trained the model and are analyzing the predictions. You determine that the bias in the model predictions is 3.0 and the variance is also 3.0. You decide to tweak the model hyperparameters and train the model again on the same dataset. When you analyze the new predictions, you get a bias of 4.0 and a variance of 2.0

How has the Mean Square Error (MSE) changed, compared to the previous model?
