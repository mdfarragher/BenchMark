      title: "The sum of the differences between the model predictions and the actual label values"
      correct: true

      title: "The average difference between a model prediction and the actual label value"
      explain: "The average difference between a model prediction and the actual label value is called the Mean Absolute Error (MAE)."

      title: "The total number of times the model generated a correct prediction"
      explain: "This metric is called the Accuracy. We don't use it for regression models because a regression prediction is almost never exactly correct."
      
    - id: answer4
      title: "The total number of correct positive predictions divided by the total number of positive predictions"
      explain: "This metric is called the Precision. We cannot use it for regression models because a regression prediction cannot be 'positive' or 'negative'."

You are building a regression model to predict the wind speed at any point on earth. During the training process, you calculate the loss value. 

What is the loss value?
