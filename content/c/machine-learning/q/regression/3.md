layout: "single"
answers:
    - id: answer1
      title: "It tries many different regression lines and converges on a solution with the highest loss value"
      explain: "The line with the highest loss value would be the worst solution, not the best."

    - id: answer2
      title: "It tries many different regression lines and converges on a solution with a loss of zero"
      explain: "Linear regression never reaches a loss of zero because each prediction is always slightly wrong. A loss of zero indicates that there is something wrong with the training process."

    - id: answer3
      title: "It tries many different regression lines and converges on a solution with the lowest loss value"
      correct: true

      title: "It calculates the best possible line instantly using advanced differential calculus"
      explain: "Linear regression does use differential calculus, but the calculation is iterative, not instantaneously."

You are building a regression model to predict the wind speed at any point on earth during any time of the day. You are training your model with the linear regression learning algorithm. 

How does linear regression find the best regression line during training?
