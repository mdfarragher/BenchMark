      title: "The first model"
      explain: "The first model has the highest RMSE value, and therefore produces the worst predictions of the two."

      title: "The second model"
      correct: true

    - id: answer3
      title: "Both models produce predictions of equal quality"
      explain: "If that were so, both RMSE values should be more or less equal."

You are building a regression model to predict the wind speed at any point on earth during any time of the day. You try out different hyperparameter settings and train two wind speed models. 

The first model has an RMSE of 153.2. The second model has an RMSE of 78.9. 

Which model produces better predictions?
