      title: "It means nothing, MAE can only be used to compare the predictive quality of two models"
      explain: "We use the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to compare the predictive quality of two models, not the MAE."

      title: "It means the predictions have a variance of 12.5 km/h"
      explain: "Mean Absolute Error (MAE) does not describe variance."

You are building a regression model to predict the wind speed at any point on earth during any time of the day. You have trained your wind speed model to produce predictions in km/h. The MAE of your model is 12.5. 

What does this mean?
