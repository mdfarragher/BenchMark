You are building a regression model to predict the wind speed at any point on earth during any time of the day. You decide to train your model on latitude, longitude, time of day, and elevation features. 

After training, the MAE = 35 km/h. You are not happy with this result and decide to perform data processing on the input features in an attempt to improve the training process. 

Which processing steps might improve the quality of the predictions?
