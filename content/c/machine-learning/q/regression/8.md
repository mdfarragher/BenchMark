title: "What should you do to improve the predictions?"
type: "question"
layout: "multiple"
answers:
    - id: answer1
      title: "Bin and one-hot encode the latitude and longitude"
      correct: true

    - id: answer2
      title: "One-hot encode the time of day"
      explain: "The time of day is a numeric feature and should not be one-hot encoded."

    - id: answer3
      title: "Sparse-vector encode the elevation"
      explain: "The elevation is a numeric feature, sparse-vector encoding is for text data."
      
    - id: answer4
      title: "Normalize the time of day and elevation features"
      correct: true

more: "You could consider one-hot encoding the time of day, but first you'd have to bin the time value into a collection of buckets, say 'morning', 'noon', 'early afternoon' and so on. Then you could one-hot encode the buckets, which might improve the quality of the predictions. The given answer doesn't mention binning, however, and therefore is incorrect. "

You are building a regression model to predict the wind speed at any point on earth during any time of the day. You decide to train your model on latitude, longitude, time of day, and elevation features. 

After training, the MAE = 35 km/h. You are not happy with this result and decide to perform data processing on the input features in an attempt to improve the training process. 

Which processing steps might improve the quality of the predictions?
