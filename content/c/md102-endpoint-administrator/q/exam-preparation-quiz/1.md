Your organisation has a Microsoft 365 subscription, and uses Microsoft Intune Suite to manage devices. You have set up an iOS app protection policy with the following configuration:

| Access requirement                                       | Setting  |
|----------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| PIN for access                                           | Require  |
| Touch ID instead of PIN for access (iOS8+/iPadOS)        | Allow    |
| Override biometrics with PIN after timeout               | Require  |
| Timeout (minutes of inactivity)                          | 30       |
| Face ID instead of PIN for access (iOS11+/iPadOS)        | Block    |
| App PIN when device PIN is set                           | Require  |
| Work or school account credentials for access            | Require  |
| Recheck the access requirements after minutes of inactivity | 30       |

What will the user be prompted for after 30 minutes of inactivity?
