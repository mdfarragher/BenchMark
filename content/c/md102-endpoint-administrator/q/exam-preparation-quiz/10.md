MDFT Pro has a Microsoft 365 E5 subscription that contains a user named MARK and a web app named QUIZAPP. You need to make sure that QUIZAPP will only accept modern authentication requests.

You plan to create a conditional access policy that will have the following settings:

| Setting           | Value                          |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| Users:            | Specific users included: MARK |
| Target resources: | Select resources: QUIZAPP         |
| Conditions:       |                                |
| Grant:            | Block access                   |

You need to block only legacy authentication requests to QUIZAPP. Which condition should you add to the policy?
