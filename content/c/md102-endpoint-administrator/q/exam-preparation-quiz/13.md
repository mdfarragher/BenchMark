MDFT Pro has a Microsoft 365 subscription that uses Microsoft Intune Suite to manage devices. You have a Windows 11 device named LAPTOP01 that is enrolled in Intune. LAPTOP01 has been offline for 30 days.

You need to remove LAPTOP01 from Intune immediately. The solution must ensure that if the device checks in again, any apps and data provisioned by Intune are removed. User-installed apps, personal data, and OEM-installed apps must be retained.

What should you use?
