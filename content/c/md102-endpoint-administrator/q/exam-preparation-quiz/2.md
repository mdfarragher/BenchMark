You are working for MDFT Academy, a well-known training agency. MDFT Academy has a Microsoft 365 subscription, and uses Microsoft Intune Suite to manage devices. You have set up an iOS app protection policy with the following configuration:

| Conditional Launch Setting    | Value | Action                    |
|-------------------------------|-------|---------------------------|
| Max PIN attempts              | 5     | Reset PIN                 |
| Offline grace period          | 720   | Block access (minutes)    |
| Offline grace period          | 90    | Wipe data (days)          |
| Jailbroken/rooted devices     |       | Block access              |
