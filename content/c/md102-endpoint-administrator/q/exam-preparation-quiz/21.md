      title: "Applicability Rules"
      explain: "Applicability Rules determine the conditions under which a policy applies based on device properties. LAPTOP01 and LAPTOP02 both use the same operating system, so a rule cannot be used to target a specific device."

MDFT Pro has configured an Azure AD group named STUDENTS. This group contains two Windows 10 Enterprise devices named LAPTOP01 and LAPTOP02. You create a device configuration policy named Policy1. You assign Policy1 to STUDENTS.

Now, you need to ensure that Policy1 applies to LAPTOP01 only. What should you modify in the policy?
