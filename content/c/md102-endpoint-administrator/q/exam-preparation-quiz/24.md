Your network contains an on-premises Active Directory domain and an Azure AD tenant.
The Default Domain Policy Group Policy Object (GPO) contains the following settings:

| Name                | GPO value |
|---------------------|-----------|
| LockoutBadCount     | 0         |
| MaximumPasswordAge  | 42        |
| MinimumPasswordAge  | 1         |
| MinimumPasswordLen  | 7         |
| PasswordComplexity  | True      |
| PasswordHistorySize | 24        |

You need to migrate the existing Default Domain Policy GPO settings to a device configuration policy. Which device configuration policy type template should you use?
