Your organization has an Azure AD tenant that contains the following users:

| Name   | Member of |
|--------|-----------|
| User l | Group 1   |
| User 2 | Group 2   |

You have the following devices enrolled in Microsoft Intune:

| Name     | Platform   | Member of |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| Device l | Windows 10 | Group 1   |
| Device 2 | Android    | Group 1   |
| Device 3 | iOS        | Group 2   |

From Intune, you create and send a custom notification to Group 1. Will User1 receive the notification on Device 1?
