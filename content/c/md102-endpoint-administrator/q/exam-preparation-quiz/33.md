Your organization has an Azure AD tenant that contains the following users:

| Name   | Member of |
|--------|-----------|
| USERl | GROUP1   |
| USER2 | GROUP2   |

You have the following devices enrolled in Microsoft Intune:

| Name     | Platform   | Member of |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| LAPTOP01 | Windows 10 | GROUP1   |
| PHONE02 | Android    | GROUP1   |
| PHONE03 | iOS        | GROUP2   |

From Intune, you create and send a custom notification to GROUP1. Will USER2 receive the notification on PHONE02?
