MDFT Academy has 100 computers that run Windows 10. There are no servers, and all the computers are joined to Azure AD. The computers have different update settings, and some computers are configured for manual updates.

You need to configure Windows Update as follows:
- The configuration must be managed from a central location.
- Internet traffic must be minimized.
- Costs must be minimized.
