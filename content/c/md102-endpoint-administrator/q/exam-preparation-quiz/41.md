Your network contains an Active Directory domain named contoso.com. The domain contains a computer named Computer 1 that runs Windows 10. You have the groups set up as follows:

| Name    | Type                         | Location    |
|---------|------------------------------|-------------|
| GROUPl | Universal distribution group | Contoso.com |
| GROUP2 | Global security group        | Contoso.com |
| GROUP3 | Local group                       | Computer l  |
| GROUP4 | Local group                       | Computer l  |

Which of these groups can you add to GROUP4?
