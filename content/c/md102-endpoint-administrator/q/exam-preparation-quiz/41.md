Your network contains an Active Directory domain named contoso.com. The domain contains a computer named Computer 1 that runs Windows 10. You have the groups set up as follows:

| Name    | Type                         | Location    |
|---------|------------------------------|-------------|
| Group l | Universal distribution group | Contoso.com |
| Group 2 | Global security group        | Contoso.com |
| Group 3 | Group                        | Computer l  |
| Group 4 | Group                        | Computer l  |

Which of these groups can you add to Group 4?
