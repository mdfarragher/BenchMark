Your organization has a Microsoft 365 E5 subscription that uses Microsoft Intune with the following devices enrolled:

| Name     | Member of        | BitLocker Drive Encryption |
|----------|------------------|----------------------------|
| Device l | Group 1          | Enabled                    |
| Device 2 | Group 1, Group 3 | Disabled                   |
| Device 3 | Group 1, Group 2 | Enabled                    |

You deploy a new device compliance policy configured as follows:

| Setting                                | Value                     |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Compliance - Require Bitlocker         | Require                   |
| Compliance - Actions for noncompliance | Mark device noncompliant  |
| Assignments - Included groups          | Group1, Group 3           |
| Assignments - Excluded groups          | Group 2                   |

Will Device 1 have the policy assigned and be marked as compliant?
