      title: "Yes"
      explain: "LAPTOP03 is in GROUP2 which is a policy assigned excluded group. Exclusion takes precedence over inclusion, so the assigned inclusion to GROUP1 is ignored. The policy is not assigned, and the unassigned device is marked compliant by default."

Your organization has a Microsoft 365 E5 subscription that uses Microsoft Intune with the following devices enrolled:

| Name     | Member of        | BitLocker Drive Encryption |
|----------|------------------|----------------------------|
| LAPTOP0l | GROUP1          | Enabled                    |
| LAPTOP02 | GROUP1, GROUP3 | Disabled                   |
| LAPTOP03 | GROUP1, GROUP2 | Enabled                    |

You deploy a new device compliance policy configured as follows:

| Setting                                | Value                     |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Compliance - Require Bitlocker         | Require                   |
| Compliance - Actions for noncompliance | Mark device noncompliant  |
| Assignments - Included groups          | GROUP1, GROUP3           |
| Assignments - Excluded groups          | GROUP2                   |

Will LAPTOP03 have the policy assigned and be marked as compliant?
