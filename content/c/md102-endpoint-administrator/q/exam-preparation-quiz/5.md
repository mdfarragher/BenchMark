Your organization has multiple devices enrolled in Microsoft Intune. Each devices has an app called 'App1' installed on it. 

The devices are running the following operating systems:

| Device Name | Operating System |
|-------------|------------------|
| Device 1    | Windows 10       |
| Device 2    | Android 8        |
| Device 3    | Android 9        |
| Device 4    | iOS 11.0         |
| Device 5    | iOS 11.4.1       |

You need to prevent users from copying data from App1 and pasting the data into other apps.
