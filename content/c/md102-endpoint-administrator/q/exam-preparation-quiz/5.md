MDFT Pro has multiple devices enrolled in Microsoft Intune. Each devices has an app called 'QUIZAPP' installed on it. 

The devices are running the following operating systems:

| Device Name | Operating System |
|-------------|------------------|
| LAPTOP01    | Windows 10       |
| PHONE02    | Android 8        |
| PHONE03    | Android 9        |
| PHONE04    | iOS 11.0         |
| PHONE05    | iOS 11.4.1       |

You need to prevent users from copying data from QUIZAPP and pasting the data into other apps.
