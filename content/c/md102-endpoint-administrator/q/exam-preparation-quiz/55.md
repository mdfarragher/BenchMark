Your organization has a Microsoft 365 subscription that uses Microsoft Intune Suite. Your network contains an on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain that syncs with an Azure AD tenant by using Azure AD Connect.

You use Microsoft Intune and Configuration Manager to manage devices. You need to recommend a deployment plan for new Windows 11 devices. The solution must meet the following requirements:

- Devices must be Azure AD joined. The devices will be shipped directly from the manufacturer to the homes of the users.
- Administrative effort must be minimized.
