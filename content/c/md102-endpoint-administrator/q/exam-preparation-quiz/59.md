Your organization uses Azure AD, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Intune, and Azure Information Protection. Your security policy states the following:

- Personal devices do not need to be enrolled in Intune.
- Users must authenticate by using a PIN before they can access corporate email data.
- Users can use their personal iOS and Android devices to access corporate cloud services.
- Users must be prevented from copying corporate email data to a cloud storage service other than Microsoft OneDrive for Business.

You need to configure a solution to enforce the security policy. What should you create?
