MDFT Academy has an Azure AD tenant named mdft.academy that contains several Windows 10 devices. When you join new Windows 10 devices to mdft.academy, users are prompted to set up a four-digit pin. But you need to ensure that the users are prompted to set up a six-digit pin when they join the Windows 10 devices to mdft.academy.

To implement the six-digit pin, you access the Microsoft Entra admin center and modify the User settings and the Device settings.

Does this meet the goal?
