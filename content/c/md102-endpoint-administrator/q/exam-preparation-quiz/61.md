Your organization has an Azure AD tenant named contoso.com that contains several Windows 10 devices. When you join new Windows 10 devices to contoso.com, users are prompted to set up a four-digit pin. But you need to ensure that the users are prompted to set up a six-digit pin when they join the Windows 10 devices to contoso.com.

To implement the six-digit pin, you access the Microsoft Entra admin center and configure automatic mobile device management (MDM) enrollment. Then you access Microsoft Intune admin center and create and assign a device restrictions policy.

Does this meet the goal?
