Your organization has an Azure AD tenant named contoso.com that contains several Windows 10 devices. When you join new Windows 10 devices to contoso.com, users are prompted to set up a four-digit pin. But you need to ensure that the users are prompted to set up a six-digit pin when they join the Windows 10 devices to contoso.com.

To implement the six-digit pin, you access the Microsoft Entra admin center and configure automatic mobile device management (MDM) enrollment. Then you access Microsoft Intune admin center and configure the Windows Hello for Business enrollment options.

Does this meet the goal?
