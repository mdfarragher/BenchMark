      title: "On SERVER02, run the Enable-PSRemoting cmdlet"
      correct: true

      title: "On SERVER02, add SERVER01 to the Remote Management Users group"
      explain: "The Remote Management Users group controls which users can connect to a computer using WS-Management. Adding SERVER01 to this group would only be necessary for specific WS-Management scenarios, not for basic PowerShell remoting which uses Windows Remote Management (WinRM) and relies on standard domain authentication."

      title: "From Active Directory, configure the Trusted for Delegation setting for the computer account of SERVER02"
      explain: "Trusted for Delegation is an Active Directory setting that allows a service to impersonate a user to access resources on other computers. This advanced Kerberos delegation setting is used for multi-hop scenarios where credentials need to be passed through multiple computers, which is not required for basic PowerShell remoting between two computers."

      title: "On SERVER01, run the New-PSSession cmdlet"
      explain: "The New-PSSession cmdlet creates a persistent PowerShell session with a remote computer. However, it requires that PowerShell remoting is already enabled and properly configured on the target computer. Running this cmdlet first would fail because the WinRM service needs to be configured on SERVER02 using Enable-PSRemoting before any remote connections can be established."

Your network contains an Active Directory domain named contoso.com. The domain contains two computers named SERVER01 and SERVER02 that run Windows 10. On SERVER01, you need to run the Invoke-Command cmdlet to execute several PowerShell commands on SERVER02.

What should you do first?
