    title: "On SERVER02, run the Enable-PSRemoting cmdlet"
    correct: true

    title: "On SERVER02, add SERVER01 to the Remote Management Users group"
    explain: "The Remote Management Users group controls which user accounts (not computer accounts) are allowed to connect via PowerShell remoting when they are not local administrators. This step is only required if the user initiating the remote session is not an administrator on SERVER02. Usually, the user has admin rights and this step is unnecessary."

    title: "From Active Directory, configure the Trusted for Delegation setting for the computer account of SERVER02"
    explain: "Trusted for Delegation is used for Kerberos-based multi-hop authentication, allowing a service to impersonate users to access resources on another computer. This is not needed for a basic one-to-one PowerShell remoting session."

  - id: answer4
    title: "On SERVER01, run the New-PSSession cmdlet"
    explain: "New-PSSession can create a persistent remote PowerShell session, but it requires PowerShell remoting to already be enabled and properly configured on the target computer (SERVER02). Without running Enable-PSRemoting first, this command will fail."

Your network contains an Active Directory domain named contoso.com. The domain contains two computers named SERVER01 and SERVER02 that run Windows 10. On SERVER01, you need to run the Invoke-Command cmdlet to execute several PowerShell commands on SERVER02.

What should you do first?
