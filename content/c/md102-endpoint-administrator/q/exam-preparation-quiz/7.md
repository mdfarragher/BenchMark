Your organization has a Microsoft 365 subscription that uses Microsoft Intune Suite. You are using Microsoft Intune to manage devices, and you plan to deploy two apps named App1 and App2 to all Windows devices. App1 must be installed before App2.

From the Intune admin center, you create two Windows win32 apps. You need to ensure that App1 is installed before App2 on every device.
