      title: "Configure Windows Defender Firewall"
      explain: "Configuring the firewall alone won't enable Log Analytics queries. Windows Defender Firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic, but configuring it does not establish the required authentication and connectivity to Azure Log Analytics."

      title: "Create an event subscription"
      explain: "Event subscriptions are not required for Log Analytics queries. Event subscriptions are used to route events from an event source to a destination for event handling and automation, which is unrelated to querying logs from a workgroup computer."

      title: "Install the Azure Monitor Agent"
      explain: "The Azure Monitor Agent is required for collecting monitoring data from the operating system and sending it to Azure Monitor, but it requires proper authentication through Azure AD to function correctly. You must first join the device to Azure AD."

Your organization has a Microsoft Azure subscription that contains an Azure Log Analytics workspace. You deploy a new computer named LAPTOP01 that runs Windows 10. LAPTOP01 is in a workgroup. You need to ensure that you can use Log Analytics to query events from LAPTOP01.

What should you do first on LAPTOP01?
