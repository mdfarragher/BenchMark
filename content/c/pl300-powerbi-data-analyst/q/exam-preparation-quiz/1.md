You are a business intelligence analyst for MDFT Pro, a well-known training organization. MDFT Pro operates globally and regularly analyzes sales data to improve its training offerings and reach new students.

You have created a Power BI report that visualizes sales data for the entire organization. Now, you have been asked to provide a version of this report that only displays data for a single country, so that local managers can focus on their region's performance.

What should you do to provide a filtered version of the report for a specific country?
