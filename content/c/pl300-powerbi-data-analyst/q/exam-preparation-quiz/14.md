You are a report owner at MDFT Academy. You are importing a dataset with a dynamic column, which may change format occasionally and cause errors. You want to ensure that errors do not disrupt the refresh process and that you can investigate them later.

You need to prevent these errors from showing in the refresh and build a detailed exception report for further investigation. Which actions should you perform to achieve this?
