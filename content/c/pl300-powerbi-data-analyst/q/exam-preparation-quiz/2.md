MDFT Academy is managing training solutions using multiple Azure SQL Server databases. Each client company has its own database provisioned in an Azure subscription managed by MDFT Academy.

The data engineers are interested in building a report to measure student performance using Power BI Desktop. Each client company may have different requirements for building the report. Each data engineer should work to build a report for a specific company, using a different database from their peers.

How should you support the data engineers to connect to the correct database for each company?
