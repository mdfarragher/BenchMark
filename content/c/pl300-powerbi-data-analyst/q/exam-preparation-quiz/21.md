You create a dataset using Power BI Desktop for MDFT Academy. Your source data contains many columns with dates, including a column for marketing campaign end dates where users enter December 31, 2999 if there is no end date. The Auto date/time option is enabled.

For each statement below, select Yes if it is true, otherwise select No. How does the Auto date/time feature affect your dataset and what should you consider when working with date hierarchies?
