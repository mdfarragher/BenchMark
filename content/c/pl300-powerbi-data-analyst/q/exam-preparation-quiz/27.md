You create a Power BI dataset at MDFT Academy using DirectQuery and local Excel files. The dataset includes tables for sales, country, and product managers, each with different refresh behaviors.

You need to explain to a user when the data in the visualizations was last refreshed. When was the data in the visuals refreshed for each table?
