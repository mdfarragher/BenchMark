You create a Power BI report at MDFT Academy using an Excel workbook stored on OneDrive for Business as the data source. The academy regularly updates the workbook with new data and wants the report to keep working without rebuilding visuals or queries.

You need to replace the workbook with a new version containing updated data, without editing the report. What should you consider to ensure the report remains functional?
