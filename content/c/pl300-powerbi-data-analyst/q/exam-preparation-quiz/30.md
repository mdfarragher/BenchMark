title: "Show Last Refreshed Date/Time In Power BI Reports"

answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "= DateTimeZone.UtcNow()"
      explain: "DateTimeZone.UtcNow() returns the current UTC date and time, but does not create a table or column for use in Power BI reports. It is not the recommended approach for displaying refresh time."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "= DateTime.From(DateTime.LocalNow)"
      explain: "DateTime.From(DateTime.LocalNow) converts the local time to a datetime value, but does not generate a table structure required for displaying the refresh time in a report."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "= #table({\"Refreshed\"}, {{DateTime.FixedLocalNow()}})"
      correct: true
      explain: "This M code creates a one-row, one-column table with the fixed local date/time at the moment the query was evaluated (i.e., when the dataset was last refreshed). DateTime.FixedLocalNow() captures the refresh timestamp reliably, and the table structure allows the value to be used directly in report visuals."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "= #table({\"Refreshed\"}, {{DateTime.LocalNow()}})"
      explain: "Although this creates a table with the current local date/time, DateTime.LocalNow() re-evaluates dynamically whenever the query or visuals recalculate, which can lead to inconsistent or misleading timestamps that do not necessarily reflect the true refresh time."

You have a Power BI dataset at MDFT Academy that uses import storage mode with scheduled refreshes. The academy wants to display the last refresh date and time on reports and dashboards for transparency.

You have been asked to add a new query in Power BI and use custom M code to calculate and display the last refresh date and time. 

Which M code should you use to achieve this?
