      correct: true
      explain: "OLS restricts access to the Payroll table to managers, and RLS filters rows so each manager only sees salaries from their department."

You have a dataset in Power BI at MDFT Pro with tables for Employees, Payroll, Sales, and Students. Each table has different security requirements to protect sensitive information:

- Only HR can access the Employees table
- Only managers can access the Payroll table, and they can only access salaries from their own department
- Everybody can access the Sales table, but Employees can only access Sales records from their own business unit
- Only HR can access the Students table

How should you implement data access for each table to ensure the right level of security?
