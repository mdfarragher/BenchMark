title: "Create Average Profit Measure For Visualizations In Power BI"
type: "question"
layout: "multiple"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "AVERAGEX"
      correct: true
      explain: "AVERAGEX iterates over a table, evaluating an expression for each row and calculating the average. This ensures the measure works properly with CALCULATE and respects the filter context."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "KEEPFILTERS"
      correct: true
      explain: "KEEPFILTERS can be used inside CALCULATE to combine external and internal filters without overwriting them, which can be important for precise control of filtering behavior."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "AVERAGE"
      explain: "AVERAGE calculates the arithmetic mean of a column in the current context, but does not evaluate an expression per row. It is not reliable when you need row-level calculations."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "ALL"
      explain: "ALL removes filters, which can be useful in some advanced calculations, but it’s not appropriate here since the goal is to have the measure respect filters and slicers."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "CALCULATE"
      correct: true
      explain: "CALCULATE adjusts filter context, which is often necessary when creating flexible measures that need to respond to report filters and slicers. It’s essential for many advanced measure scenarios."
    - id: "answer6"
      title: "FILTER"
      correct: true
      explain: "FILTER is used to create filtered tables within AVERAGEX or CALCULATE, allowing you to include or exclude rows as needed for precise calculations."
    - id: "answer7"
      title: "SUMMARIZE"
      explain: "SUMMARIZE groups data into summary tables, which is unnecessary when simply calculating an average profit measure."

You need to create a measure for the average profit for product sales at MDFT Academy, for use in Power BI report visuals. The measure must calculate the average profit per row in your sales data and behave correctly so that filters and slicers affect it accurately.

Which DAX functions are typically used to build a robust average profit measure for this scenario?
