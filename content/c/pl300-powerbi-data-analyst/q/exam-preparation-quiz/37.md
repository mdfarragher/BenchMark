You have an Orders table at MDFT Academy with OrderDate and ShippingDate columns. The academy wants to analyze sales by the date products are shipped, not just when they are ordered.

You have the following DAX expression:

```dax
Sales By Shipping Date :=
CALCULATE(
    SUM(Orders[SalesAmount]),
    ________ ('Date'[Date], Orders[ShippingDate])
)
```

You need to complete the DAX expression by filling in the missing text. What should you add?
