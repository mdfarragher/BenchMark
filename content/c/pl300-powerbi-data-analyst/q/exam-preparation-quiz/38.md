You use the PERCENTILEX.EXC function in a measure to calculate the 95th percentile for sales in a Power BI report at MDFT Pro. The academy wants to identify top-performing sales but encounters an error in the visualization due to too few values in the range.

How should you resolve the error and show the 95th percentile in your report?
