At MDFT Academy, you create a report about course completion rates and student dropout rates. The academy is interested in identifying which courses have the highest dropout rates to improve student retention.

You need to restrict the visual to show the top five courses with the highest dropout rates. What should you do to achieve this in your Power BI report?
