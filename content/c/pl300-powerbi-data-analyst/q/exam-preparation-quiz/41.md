Your data model at MDFT Pro contains Product, Sales, and Calendar tables. The requirements for each table are as follows:

- The Product table is small and updated infrequently
- The Calendar table is small and updated infrequently
- The Sales table is very large and needs immediate updates for accurate reporting

Which storage mode should you use for each table to ensure optimal performance and data freshness?
