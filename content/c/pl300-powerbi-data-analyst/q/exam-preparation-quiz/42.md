      title: "[Sales] - [Cogs]"
      correct: true
      explain: "This expression references the existing explicit measures for Sales and Cogs directly. Defining the Margin measure this way ensures flexibility, scalability, and consistency in your model. It also makes maintenance easy if your Sales or Cogs calculations change."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "CALCULATE(SUM(SalesTable[SalesAmount])) - CALCULATE(SUM(SalesTable[CogsAmount]))"
      explain: "This expression works for calculating margin but does not reference existing explicit measures. Using SUM directly on columns creates dependencies on raw columns, making the measure less flexible if your calculations for Sales or Cogs become more complex. Also, CALCULATE is unnecessary here if you aren’t modifying filter context."

      title: "SUM(SalesTable[SalesAmount]) - SUM(SalesTable[CogsAmount])"
      explain: "This expression works for calculating margin but does not reference existing explicit measures. Using SUM directly on columns creates dependencies on raw columns, making the measure less flexible if your calculations for Sales or Cogs become more complex."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "SUMX(SalesTable, SalesTable[SalesAmount] - SalesTable[CogsAmount])"
      explain: "SUMX performs row-by-row calculations, which can be useful for certain scenarios (e.g., if unit costs vary per row), but it adds unnecessary complexity if you already have explicit measures. For aggregated sales and cogs, SUMX is not needed."

You have a Power BI data model at MDFT Pro with explicit measures for Sales and Cogs (Cost of Goods Sold). The measures are defined as follows:

```dax
Sales := SUM(SalesTable[SalesAmount])
Cogs := SUM(SalesTable[CogsAmount])
```

The academy’s finance team wants a Margin measure for detailed analysis and reporting. You need to calculate the margin using existing explicit measures to ensure maximum flexibility and scalability in your model.

Which DAX expression should you use to define the Margin measure?
