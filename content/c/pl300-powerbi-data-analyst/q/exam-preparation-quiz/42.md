      title: "CALCULATE(SUM(Table[Sales])) - CALCULATE(SUM(Table[COGS]))"
      correct: true
      explain: "Explicit measures using CALCULATE provide flexibility and scalability for complex models."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "SUM(Table[Sales]) - SUM(Table[COGS])"
      explain: "This uses implicit measures, which are less flexible and scalable."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "[Sales] - [COGS]"
      explain: "This also uses implicit measures and is not recommended for complex models."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "SUMX(Table, Table[Sales] - Table[COGS])"
      explain: "SUMX can be used for row-by-row calculations, but explicit measures are preferred for margin calculations."

You have a Power BI data model at MDFT Academy with Sales and COGS measures. The academy's finance team wants to calculate margin for detailed analysis and reporting.

You need to calculate Margin using explicit measures. Which DAX expression should you use to ensure flexibility and scalability in your model?
