type: "question"
layout: "multiple"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Create a new table named Telemetry_Aggregate containing the columns to hold aggregate data."
      correct: true
      explain: "You must first create an aggregation table to store summarized data."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Open the Manage aggregations dialog."
      correct: true
      explain: "The Manage aggregations dialog allows you to map the columns of the Telemetry_Aggregate table to the detailed Telemetry table and define how aggregations are performed."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Select the Telemetry_Aggregate table as the aggregation table."
      correct: true
      explain: "Designating the Telemetry_Aggregate table as the aggregation table enables Power BI to use it for query acceleration and summarized data retrieval."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "For each aggregation column, choose the appropriate summarization (Group By, Count, Sum, Average)"
      correct: true
      explain: "Selecting the correct summarization for each column ensures that the aggregation table accurately represents the summarized data needed for analysis."
    - id: "answer5"
      title: "For each aggregation column, select the table and column from the Telemetry table."
      correct: true
      explain: "Mapping each aggregation column to the corresponding source column in the Telemetry table allows Power BI to relate the summarized data to the detailed data."
    - id: "answer6"
      title: "Create a calculated column for each aggregation."
      explain: "Calculated columns are not required for aggregations."

You have a dataset with a very large Telemetry table at MDFT Pro and want to reduce its size. The Telemetry table contains multiple records per day, and the academy needs to analyze summarized data efficiently.

You want to create aggregations for the table columns 'eventValue' and 'eventDuration'. Which steps are required to create and configure an aggregation table in Power BI?
