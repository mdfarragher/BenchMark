You have a very large dataset at MDFT Academy and want to reduce its size. The Telemetry table contains multiple records per day, and the academy needs to analyze summarized data efficiently.

You want to create aggregations for date, devicetype, readingtype, and readingvalue. Which actions should you perform in sequence to optimize your data model?
