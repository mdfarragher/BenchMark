type: "question"
layout: "multiple"
answers:
    - id: "answer1"
      title: "Remove columns not used in reports from the data model"
      correct: true
      explain: "Removing unnecessary columns (vertical filtering) reduces model size and improves refresh time."
    - id: "answer2"
      title: "Hide columns in the data model"
      explain: "Hidden columns are still processed and don't reduce model size or improve performance."
    - id: "answer3"
      title: "Summarize data and create aggregations"
      correct: true
      explain: "Summarizing data is the most effective technique to reduce model size and improve performance."
    - id: "answer4"
      title: "Increase the refresh frequency of the dataset"
      explain: "Increasing refresh frequency does not improve model performance; it only updates data more often."

You create a data model and report in Power BI Desktop to analyze student performance at MDFT Pro. The report runs well in the development environment, but when deployed to production, the model and report have performance issues.

You need to improve the model's performance. What actions should you take to optimize the report for production use?
