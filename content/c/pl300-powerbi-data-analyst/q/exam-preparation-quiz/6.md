You create a report page and pin the page to a dashboard in the Power BI service for MDFT Pro. Trainers and students frequently ask questions about the data and request additional visuals on the dashboard.

You need to enable the Q&A feature that appears as "Ask a question about your data" at the top of the dashboard above the visuals. How should you enable this feature for your users?
