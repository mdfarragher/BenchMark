You are building a Power BI dataset and report at MDFT Pro. Your dataset tables use the Import storage mode.

Users have reported that the Q&A visual does not understand certain business terms related to your STUDENTS table. You want to improve the experience by teaching Q&A the following five terms: "Attendance", "Grade", "Assignment", "Exceed", and "Enrolled". You also want to use aggregations in your Q&A visual.
